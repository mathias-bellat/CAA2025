The survey questionnaire basically consisted of three parts which are concerned with identifying the socio-cultural status, the personal tendencies, and evaluation of the physical and auditory environment. Before constructing of grounding the predictive model, data went through analyses to
normalize and to eliminate the irrelevant items. Preliminary findings demonstrated how an indoor auditory environment would be perceived based on the individuals' socio-cultural status, tendencies, preference and expectation from the space and physical elements of the space with together constructing
a preliminary grounding model to use Machine / Deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {More than 16 million Americans served in World War I. Of these service members, over 400,000 were killed in action during the war. Today, more than 72,000 service members remain unaccounted for from World War II. The United States continues to diligently locate, recover, and identify missing personnel from World War H and other past conflicts to provide the fullest possible accounting. This work importantly provides closure and resolution to numerous US families. To fulfill this mission, massive amounts of information must be integrated from historical records, genealogy records, anthropological data, archeological data, odontology data, and DNA. These disparate data sources are produced and maintained by multiple agencies, with different data governance rules and different internal structuring of service member information. Previously, a manual approach had been undertaken to Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) records from these different data sources, which creates the potential for introduced human error. In addition, a large number of person-hours were required to synthesize this data on a biweekly basis. To address this issue, we implemented (i) a regex decision tree to translate genealogical relationships into DNA type availability and (ii) a machine learning approach for record-linkage between disparate data sources. This application is currently in production and greatly reduces person-hours needed and has a very low error rate for record translation and integration.},

In this paper, a promising new technique for the automated detection of multiple classes of archaeological objects in LiDAR data is presented. This technique is based on R-CNNs (Regions-based Convolutional Neural Networks). Unlike normal CNNs, which classify the entire input image, R-CNNs address the problem of object detection, which requires correctly localising and classifying (multiple) objects within a larger image. We have incorporated this technique into a workflow, which enables the preprocessing of LiDAR data into the required data format and the conversion of the results of the object detection into geographical data, usable in a GIS environment. The proposed technique has been trained and tested on LiDAR data gathered from the central part of the Netherlands. This area contains a multitude of archaeological objects, including prehistoric barrows and Celtic fields. The initial experiments show that we are able to automatically detect and categorise these two types of archaeological objects and thus proof the added value of this technique.},

Meanwhile, it is archaeology that opens up impressive opportunities for various interdisciplinary studies at the junction of archaeology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. XRF analysis, which has long been used to determine the qualitative and quantitative composition of discovered archaeological artifacts, among other things, provides arrays of digital information that can be used by machine learning methods for more accurate clustering or classification of artifacts. This is especially true for artifacts that are presented in the form of fragments of ancient ceramic amphorae or glass vessels. Such fragments, as a rule, represent the mass of the fragments mixed among themselves. There is a need to divide them into groups and then restore them as a single artifact from the detected fragments of one group. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the application of different clustering methods to combine artifacts into groups with similar properties.},

However, in the past few years, and with the emergence of Digital Humanities and Computational Archaeology, researchers have started to apply an array of computational methods and geographical analysis tools in order to understand the role that space plays in the historical processes of human societies. As a result, historians and archaeologists, together with computer scientists, are currently developing digital approaches that can be used to address questions and solve problems regarding the geographies contained in documentary sources such as texts and historical maps. Digging into Early Colonial Mexico is an interdisciplinary project that applies a Data Science/Big Data approach to historical archaeology, focusing on the analysis of one of the most important historical sources of the 16th century in Latin America, called the Geographic Reports of New Spain. The purpose of this paper is to: a) describe the nature of the historical corpus, b) introduce the methodologies and preliminary results produced so far by the project, and c) explain some of the theoretical and technical challenges faced throughout the development of the methods and techniques that supported the analysis of the historical corpus.},

This software, by using images extracted from a DTM (Digital Terrain Model), aims to automatically detect archaeological structures. The first step is to do a manual research and vectorise some of the structures. Then, we use them to create binary images which are classified by the software and compared to the pixels on the 8 bit DTM image using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. Afterwards, the software is able to recognize these types of pixels and their neighbours based on their grayscale values (representing altitude differences). It will recognize similar structures on another DTM image by analysing the value of the pixels. For this presentation, we will focus on two examples, firstly with linear structures (embankments) and secondly with point structures (charcoal burning platforms) ; and on two different wooded areas in the Centre region of France. The software was first developed for linear structures, therefore it has a good recognition rate for these remains. The use for discrete structures, more recent, needs to be improved but the results are encouraging. One of the main issues is that the software is extremely dependent on the quality of the data and on the learning datasets in particular. Manual exploration is necessary to build the learning datasets as well as for post-control to confirm results and improve determination rates.},

In a case study in the central Netherlands, we are currently developing novel methods for multi-class archaeological object detection in LiDAR data based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This research is embedded in a long-term investigation of the prehistoric landscape of our study region. We here present an innovative integrated workflow that combines machine learning approaches to automated object detection in remotely sensed data with a two-tier citizen science project that allows us to generate and validate detections of hitherto unknown archaeological objects, thereby contributing to the creation of reliable, labeled archaeological training datasets. We motivate our methodological choices in the light of current trends in archaeological prospection, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science, and present the first results of the implementation of the workflow in our research area.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing data have seen wide use in the archaeological prospection for locating and mapping archaeological sites over broad regions of interest. One of the main reasons is that often, near surface buried or partially buried archaeological sites that are indistinguishable when observed from close distance, can be readily located from space or aerial sensors by examining subtle differences in microtopography as well as geometrical and spectral properties of Earth's surface, and vegetation. However, this task can be time consuming and requires large number of experienced and specialized analysts therefore could be immensely benefitted from automation. In this work we examine the potential of deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of archaeological sites. Deep learning has gained significant attention over the last years as it outperforms traditional machine learning techniques. Some of the main disadvantages is that often requires a large amount of labeled data to achieve high accuracy levels, and that the training stage can require significant computational resources. We attempt to overcome these issues by the means of transfer learning from pre-trained models from related tasks with abundant data. We show that even with a relatively limited amount of data the retrained models can successfully and rapidly identify and classify archaeological sites, distinguishing them from features of similar characteristics. We evaluate several widely used network architectures and pretrained models and compare their performance and suitability in archaeological research in various regions in Peru.},

The overall research aims for the project involved community participation, collaboration, and outreach beyond both the federal agency and the field of archaeology to advance development of novel computer vision technologies that would allow machine-based reconstructions of 3D objects. Such technology promised to be a boon for archaeologists in terms of collections management and interpretation needs—once fully developed and accessible. But in the short term, it directly contributed to other research communities active in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area: a team of computer scientists and engineers and a team of media arts researchers. For the media arts community, the computational image data produced in the collaborative study could be leveraged as digital assets useful for populating virtual environments being developed as academic research and training projects. For the computer scientists and engineers, the research engaged with artifact shapes and designs useful for their needs of writing mathematical algorithms central to computer vision and pattern recognition development needed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) (namely decision tree learning, inductive logic programming, clustering, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian networks used in mimicking of the biological structure of the brain). The project was not something done in collaboration as we (archaeologists) knew it, but rather represented the emergence of a new creative space created beyond the realms of all the participants’ disciplinary (and federal agency) silos. The resulting entirely new community space was possible only through non-archaeologist participation in the planning and carrying out of the research project’s design. Here we examine the interplay of these differing, contributing, knowledge communities in a case study in heritage studies that both refines our understanding of the concept of heritage while reminding us of the necessity and benefits of sharing archaeological knowledge through engagement with “others.” We draw upon Pierre Lévy’s ideas of “Collective Intelligence” and Henry Jenkins’ notion of “Convergence Culture” to explore the relationships, communications, learning, and opportunities that evolved in this “collaboration” between archaeologists and non-archaeologists applying computer vision technology to cultural heritage.},

It expands upon initial research to explore the 'rhetoric' and structure behind the use and manipulation of images and text by this collecting community, topics explored using Google Inception v.3, TensorFlow, etc. (Huffer and Graham 2017; 2018). This current research goes beyond that work to address the ethical and moral dilemmas that can confound the use of new technology to classify and sort thousands of images. The categories used to 'train' the machine are self-determined by the researchers, but to what extent can current image classifying methods be broken to create false positives or false negatives when attempting to classify images taken from social media sales records as either old authentic items or recent forgeries made using remains sourced from unknown locations? What potential do they have to be exploited by dealers or forgers as a way to 'authenticate the market'? Analysing the data obtained when 'scraping' image or text relevant to cultural property trafficking of any kind involves the use of machine learning and neural network analysis, the ethics of which are themselves complicated. Here, we discuss these issues around two case studies; the ongoing repatriation case of Abraham Ulrikab, and an example of what it looks like when the classifier is deliberately broken.},

Over the past 10-15 years, OBIA methods have been introduced to detect archaeological features. Improvements in accuracy have been attained by using a greater number of morphometric variables and multiple scales of analysis. This article highlights the developments that have occurred in the application of OBIA within archaeology and argues that OBIA is both a useful and necessary tool for archaeological research. Additionally, I discuss future research paths using this method. Some of the suggestions put forth here include: pushing for multifaceted research designs utilizing OBIA and manual interpretation, using OBIA methods for directly studying landscape settlement patterns, and increasing data sharing of methods between researchers.},

	abstract = {In a world that is more and more complex and full of artificial, we strike to master the changes which continuously affect every single domain of our reality and especially challenge human intelligence and cognitive capacities. The study of artificial intelligence (AI) is being exhibited as a core strategy to meet growing demands of science and applications, to solve complex problems in various areas such as environmental science, finance, health-sector, etc. Machine learning (ML) is as a subfield of AI, mainly concerned with the development of techniques and algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. In an innovative way, this work intends to survey and demonstrate the effectiveness of bringing together traditional archaeological questions, such as the analysis of settlement patterns and past human behavior, with cutting edge technologies related to Machine Learning. Computations were carried out using R free software environment for statistical computing and graphics; data pre- and post-processing was performed in a GIS (Geographical Information System) environment. We provide a data-driven basis example of archaeological predictive modeling (APM) for the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Namely, a dataset of known archaeological sites of the Roman period was considered. The APM represents an automated decision making and probabilistic reasoning tool, relevant for archaeological risk assessment and cultural heritage management. We adopted Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001), an ensemble ML algorithm based on decision trees. The model is capable of learning from data and make predictions starting from the acquired knowledge through the modelling of the hidden relationships between a set of input (i.e. geo-environmental features prone to influence site locations) and output variables (i.e. the archeological sites).As result, we obtained: 1) a ranking of geo-environmental features influencing the archeological site occurrence; 2) a map of probability expressing the likelihood of archaeological site presence, at different locations in a given landscape. These outputs become important not only to verify the reliability of the data, but also to stimulate experts in different ways: they are elicited to characterize the benefits and constraints of using such techniques and ultimately to think big about archaeological data.},

	abstract = {We propose a generalized 3D shape descriptor for the efficient classification of 3D archaeological artifacts. Our descriptor is based on a multi-view approach of curvature features, consisting of the following steps: pose normalization of 3D models, local curvature descriptor calculation, construction of 3D shape descriptor using the multi-view approach and curvature maps, and dimensionality reduction by random projections. We generate two descriptors from two different paradigms: 1) handcrafted, wherein the descriptor is manually designed for object feature extraction, and directly passed on to the classifier and 2) machine learnt, in which the descriptor automatically learns the object features through a pretrained deep neural network model (VGG-16) for transfer learning and passed on to the classifier. These descriptors are applied to two different archaeological datasets: 1) non-public Mexican dataset, represented by a collection of 963 3D archaeological objects from the Templo Mayor Museum in Mexico City that includes anthropomorphic sculptures, figurines, masks, ceramic vessels, and musical instruments; and 2) 3D pottery content-based retrieval benchmark dataset, consisting of 411 objects. Once the multi-view descriptors are obtained, we evaluate their effectiveness by using the following object classification schemes: K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and structured support vector machine. Our object descriptors classification results are compared against five popular 3D descriptors in the literature, namely, rotation invariant spherical harmonic, histogram of spherical orientations, signature of histograms of orientations, symmetry descriptor, and reflective symmetry descriptor. Experimentally, we were able to verify that our machine learnt and handcrafted descriptors offer the best classification accuracy (20\% better on average than comparative descriptors), independently of the classification methods. Our proposed descriptors are able to capture sufficient information to discern among different classes, concluding that it adequately characterizes the datasets.},

One of the goals of the project ARCHREMOTELANDS is to develop a methodology to generate those maps semi-automatically combining RPAS imagery, photogrammetry and machine learning techniques. In this context, this paper presents a conceptual framework to determine the minimum number of pixels, and so the required Ground Sampling distance and altitude needed to fly a RPAS allowing very detailed documentation and digitalization of archaeological sites by processing the acquired images. These images are used firstly to generate a high resolution orthophoto. Then, archaeological elements of interest are documented almost automatically using 2D unsupervised clustering techniques. The approach has been experimentally tested and validated in the early Christian complex of Son Peretó (Manacor, Mallorca, Spain).},

Methods deployed include point pattern analysis of stone concentrations and a machine-learning technique using unsupervised classification of visible stone signature qualities, which are used in simple linear regressions to compare with geophysical and ceramic surface survey results of a site in Iraqi Kurdistan. There is a stronger fit (r(2 )= 0.77) between surface stone concentrations and architecture identified by geophysical measurement, while surveyed ceramics show a weaker fit to defined architecture (r(2 )= 0.31). Surface stone concentrations are potentially a better proxy than ceramics for determining the presence of past settlement in regions where stone was commonly used, sites are relatively flat, and ceramics are found in low concentrations. The methods advanced here can be scaled to wider areas, particularly in mountainous regions, where surface stone features are present.},

Identifying the students who need extra support and taking the appropriate actions to enhance their performance plays an important role in achieving that goal. In this research, four machine learning techniques have been used to build a classifier that can predict the performance of the students in a computer science subject that is offered by Al-Muthanna University (MU), College Of Humanities. The machine learning techniques include Artificial Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. This research pays extra attention to the effect of using the internet as a learning resource and the effect of the time spent by students on social networks on the students’ performance. These effects introduced by using features that measure whether the student uses the internet for learning and the time spent on the social networks by the students. The models have been compared using the ROC index performance measure and the classification accuracy. In addition, different measures have been computed such as the classification error, precision, recall, and the F measure. The dataset used to build the models is collected based on a survey given to the students and the students’ grade book. The ANN (fully connected feed forward multilayer ANN) model achieved the best performance that is equal to 0.807 and achieved the best classification accuracy that is equal to 77.04\%. In addition, the decision tree model identified five factors as important factors which influence the performance of the students.},

UAV imagery processed with Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi View Stereo (MVS) techniques can provide a low-cost alternative to established shallow seabed mapping techniques offering as well the important visual information. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this paper, in order to overcome the water refraction errors, we employ machine learning tools that are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In the proposed approach, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, an SVR model was developed able to estimate more accurately the real depths of point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results over two test sites along with the performed quantitative validation indicated the high potential of the developed approach.},

Drawing on developments in computer vision and machine learning, this has the potential to fundamentally recast the capacity of archaeological prospection to cover large areas and deal with mass data, breaking a dependency on human resource. Without such developments, the potential of the vast amount of archaeological information embedded in large topographic and image-based datasets cannot be realized. The purpose of the case study reported on here is to assess existing developments in a Norwegian study against digital topographic data for the island of Arran, Scotland, examining the transferability of the approach and providing a proof of concept in a Scottish context. For Arran, three monument classes were assessed - prehistoric roundhouses, shieling huts of medieval or post-medieval date, and small clearance cairns. These present different challenges to detection, with preliminary results ranging from a manageable mix of false positives and true identifications to the chaotic. The influence of variable morphology and the occurrence of other, largely natural, objects of confusion in the landscape is discussed, highlighting the potential improvements in automated detection routines offered by adding anthropogenic and natural false positives to additional confusion classes.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists often wish to distinguish between groups of cultural artifacts using information collected from descriptions or measurements of their morphological forms. Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naive Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types.

The information that contains the empirical base for archaeology, that is, the material remains of past human activities, cannot efficiently contribute to archaeological knowledge production. This chapter explore how it might be possible to rework archaeological GIS data for reuse in research. The scope is to make it possible to use this exhaustive body of information for analyses that go beyond the scope of a single excavation or project. If archaeologists could use all the information produced in a structured way to explore the historical processes behind the data, it would be possible to start asking a whole range of new questions. For such analysis to reach full potential, it will also be necessary to adapt new methods for data analysis, building on the development of computational methods for exploring large datasets.},

	abstract = {This thesis finalises a 5+3 PhD project within the joint doctoral programme in Digital Heritage established in collaboration between History, Archaeology and Classical Studies, Graduate School, the Faculty of Arts, Aarhus University and the University of York. 

The thesis deals with the overarching theme of spatial data in archaeological excavation recording. Spatial data are at the core of all archaeological observations, and are expressed in numerous ways, ranging from traditional hand drawings to digital two- and three-dimensional representations in Geographic Information Systems and proprietary 3D software. Yet, despite technological advances, state-of-the art digital spatial data are almost equally detached from textual archaeological interpretation as they were using conventional tools decades ago. The thesis presents a study of how technological advances influence archaeological excavation traditions and methodologies. Special emphasis is directed at exploring how the increased use of image-based 3D documentation may contribute to increased quality of field recording and, in particular, what theoretical conceptualisations and technical developments are needed to harness its full potential.

The thesis is composed of four articles, which constitute individual chapters (2-5). Each chapter covers a theme within the underlying topic of integrating spatial data in archaeology, supplemented by an introductory chapter (1), a synthesis (6) and a conclusion (7).

The first article (chapter 2) provides an introduction to the overarching research questions and their methodological and historical background. It offers some rudimentary impressions of differing excavation and recording traditions in Britain and Denmark, to critically assess the use of GIS in archaeology and the negotiation between state-of-the-art technology and archaeological practice. The article discusses how the adaptation of GIS may have contributed significantly to the detrimental effect of creating stand-alone silos of spatial data that are rarely fully integrated with non-spatial, textual data, and has acted to stifle the development of digital standards of recording by perpetuating outmoded analogue recording conventions from a previous century. The chapter outlines the potential of born-digital 3D recording technologies such as Structure From Motion (SFM), GPS, and laser scanning in current practice, while advocating for a conceptualisation of new types of data and data representation in archaeological documentation. This, however, requires changes in archaeological methodologies and workflows and that we redefine more explicitly what we actually want to do with spatial data in archaeology.

The second article (chapter 3) seeks to advance the conceptual framework of 3D models within archaeological excavation recording. 3D documentation advocates for a new workflow with a more three-dimensional reasoning, allowing for the utilisation of 3D as a tool for continuous progress planning and evaluation of an excavation and its results. Just like the general use of models to form hypotheses, it is possible to use 3D models as spatial hypotheses of an ongoing excavation. This allows us to visually realise or spatially conceptualise our hypotheses as a virtual reconstruction and to combine it with our observational data. The article presents first-hand experiences of working with 3D reconstruction and visualisations during the excavations at Viking Age site Jelling, and explores how the concept of authenticity may facilitate negotiations between visualising what we know, and what we think we know.

The third article (chapter 4) further addresses the challenges inherent to the integration of 3D documentation: specifically its inability to convey archaeological interpretations. Image-based 3D modelling is generally considered a superior tool for generating geometrically accurate and photo-realistic recording of an excavation, but does not immediately encourage reflexive or interpretative practice. This is a direct consequence of the technical limitations of currently available tools, but also reflects an archaeological methodology and spatial conceptualisation based on two-dimensional abstractions. Using the example of the excavations at the Iron Age site Alken Enge, this article takes a more technical approach to exploring how new tools developed for segmenting field-recorded 3D geometry allow embedding archaeological interpretations directly in the 3D model, thereby augmenting its semantic value considerably. This is considered a precondition for the successful integration of 3D models as archaeological documentation. Furthermore, the article explores how web-based 3D platforms may facilitate collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. The event-based approach is used for conceptualising how digital spatial data are created, derived and evolve throughout the documentation and post-excavation process. This effectively means building a conceptualisation of excavation recording procedures and seeing them through to the data model implementation itself.

The fourth and last article (chapter 5) further explores the technologies outlined in chapters two and four. In particular, it focuses on evaluating analytical capabilities and alternative visualisation end-goals for 3D excavation recording. The chapter presents a simple case study, demonstrating the pipeline from excavating an archaeological feature, through image-based documentation and processing, to volumetric visual representation, while exploring the potential of machine learning to aid in feature recognition and classification.

Chapter six acts as a synopsis, which provides added context to the results of the preceding chapters and furthermore discusses archaeological data models in general, conceptual reference models and, finally, presents the data model and implementation developed during the research project.

The research introduces several novel approaches and technical developments aimed at aggregating the fragmented excavation data throughout the archaeological sector. This includes developing software for harvesting 2D GIS data from file storage at local archaeological institutions, functions for 3D semantic segmentation, automated processes for pattern recognition (SVM), machine learning and volumetric visualisation, and database mappings to web-services such as the MUD excavation database - all of which feed into the development of the Archaeo Framework. The online database {\textbackslash}url\{www.archaeo.dk\} provides an implementation of the proposed data model for complex spatial field recorded data, and demonstrates the achieved data management capabilities, analytical queries, various spatial and visual representations and data interoperability functions.

The Archaeo Framework acts as a data repository for excavation data, and provides long-awaited integration of spatial and textual data in Denmark. The benefits of spatial integration are clearly evident, notably having all information in one system, available online for research, dissemination and data re-use. For the first time, it is possible to perform large-scale validation of digital excavation plans against the written record, and perform complex spatial queries at a much deeper level than merely a site on a map.

This research frames the basis for further developments of dynamic data management approaches to the integration of complex spatial data in field archaeology. The data model is expected to assist archaeologists in implementing better conceptualised excavation data models, and to facilitate a better understanding and use of 3D for archaeological documentation and analysis. Ultimately, the implementation provides access to the inaccessible dimensions of archaeological recording by joining hitherto isolated and fragmentary archaeological datasets - spatial and textual. Future areas of investigation should seek to advance this further in order to facilitate the persistence of complex spatial data as integrated components of archaeological data models.},

	abstract = {The most time-honoured tool for understanding the processes of the human past is represented by archaeological excavation. By examining an area at discrete temporal periods, archaeologists are literally able to look backwards in time: they can analyse incomplete material records in order to understand and reconstruct the cultural history of an area at particular moments in time. Since the digging process destroys the site forever, great care must be paid during both the excavation and the documentation. In general, after a stratum has been completely excavated, both the floors and walls are cleaned and made ready for documentation. Photos of both the sides and bedrock of a given excavation are collected, and several sketches of what the archaeologists have seen in the trenches are made. In these drawings are delineated the features and shapes of artefacts on the horizontal plane. In addition, depending on the colours and similarities of the textures, drawing are also made of the archaeological layers. This approach is time-consuming, is affected by human ability, and does not make possible a prompt digitization of the results. Within this context, the automatized identification of archaeological stratigraphy during excavation work is welcomed by archaeologists. Here, a k-means unsupervised machine learning algorithm has been used for colour clustering digital images of excavation sites. The algorithm that we have developed attempts to enhance the colour similarity while keeping the colours separate one from another as much as possible. The main idea is that pixels belonging to the same colour cluster are a part of the same layer. Once the layer has been identified, a statistical approach based on Haralick features is used to characterize each strata in terms of texture. Unsupervised machine learning combined with texture analysis could become a good practice in speeding up the documentation work of archaeologists and paving the way towards the creation of an "automated archaeologist".},

	abstract = {The thesis concentrates on computational methods pertaining to ancient ostraca - ink on clay inscriptions, written in Hebrew. These texts originate from the biblical kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and dated to the late First Temple period (8th – early 6th centuries BCE). The ostraca are almost the sole remaining epigraphic evidence from the First Temple period and are therefore important for archaeological, historical, linguistic, and religious studies of this era. This “noisy” material offers a fertile ground for the development of various “robust” image analysis, image processing, computer vision and machine learning methods, dealing with the challenging domain of ancient documents’ analysis. The common procedures of modern epigraphers involve manual and labor-intensive steps, facing the risk of unintentionally mixing documentation with interpretation. Therefore, the main goal of this study is establishing a computerized paleographic framework for handling First Temple period epigraphic material. The major research questions, addressed in this thesis are: quality evaluation of manual facsimiles; quality evaluation of ostraca images; automatic binarization of the documents and its subsequent refinement; quality evaluation of binarizations on global and local levels; identification of different writers between inscriptions (two distinct methods are proposed); image segmentation (with improvements over the classical Chan-Vese algorithm); and letters’ shape prior estimation. The developed methods were tested on real-world archaeological and modern data and their results are found to be favorable.},

	abstract = {This work involves the creation of a taxonomy of three-dimensional posture and gesture combinations represented by ceramic human figures associated with shaft and chamber tombs in the western coastal states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacán and Colima of Mexico. Gordon Hewes (1966) proposed that posture and gesture of actual human subjects communicates a tremendous amount of information that was not being gathered on a consistent basis (Hewes 1966:106). While Hewes presented his paper on "The Domain Posture" fifty years ago, his observation rings true today. The three-dimensional taxonomy should demonstrate that posture and gesture are correlated with sexual characteristics and are not random, but rather, an illustration of a purposeful series of postures and gestures that transmit cultural meaning within the ancient constructs of West Mexican culture. There is an opportunity for anthropologists to begin seeing and evaluating and documenting the non-verbal communications made through posture and gesture both in artefacts crafted as figures, as in the case of the shaft tomb figures, and in modern cultural anthropology. The process of classification of the ceramic human figures according to posture and gesture takes three major steps: three-dimensional imaging, posture representation and finally classifying these representations. The three-dimensional imaging consists of creating three-dimensional models of the ceramic human figures. The posture representation consists of collecting measures of the fourteen major limb joints of the human body as they are represented in three-dimensional models of the ceramic figures. The last step is to use learning algorithms to classify the posture representation of the ceramic figures. The goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of the three-dimensional imaging to accurately and consistently identify key posture/gesture combinations for comparison with other biological and cultural variables expressed by the figures. Initially, this project focuses on archaeological material located in the Gilcrease Museum collection in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but will also utilise other collections as points of comparison. While this work will identify patterns of posture and gesture within West Mexican ceramic shaft tomb figures, its application does not end there. With the utilisation of technology in the form of three-dimensional imaging, its application spans both archaeological material from other cultures and modern cultural anthropology. This technology can advance studies related to the cultural meaning of this important class of artefacts. From a musicological perspective, this technology could become a critical element in metadata collection to document collections.},

	abstract = {The (slow) emergence of semi-automated or supervised detection techniques to identify anthropogenic objects in archaeological prospection using remote sensing data has received a mixed reception during the past decade. Critics have stressed the superiority of human vision and the irreplaceability of human judgement in recognising archaeological traces, perceiving a threat that will undermine professional expertise and that archaeological experience and knowledge could be written out of the interpretative process (e.g. Hanson 2008, 2010; Palmer \& Cowley 2010; Parcak 2009). Uneasiness amongst some archaeologists of losing control, even partially, of the interpretation process certainly seems to be a significant factor in criticisms, citing the undeniable fact that archaeological remains (or proxies for those remains) can assume a near-unlimited assortment of shapes, sizes and spectral properties. It is argued that only the human observer can deal with such complexity. Thus, while increasingly automated and supervised procedures for object detection and recognition and processing are flourishing in a variety of fields (e.g. medical imaging, facial recognition, cartography, navigation, surveillance; Szeliski 2011), their application to archaeological and, more generally, cultural landscapes is still in its infancy. However, as a number of published works (see References and General Reading List) and ongoing research demonstrate there are major benefits in developing this broad agenda.
This paper provides a general review of the issues from a synergistic rather than competitive perspective, highlighting opportunities and discussing challenges. It also summarises a

As the conditions for detecting the sex of a skeleton are not entirely known, machine learning based data mining models are appropriate to address this problem since they are able to capture unobservable patterns in data. These patterns could be relevant for classifying a skeletal remain as male or female. We propose two machine learning models based on artificial neural networks for identifying the sex of human skeletons from bone measurements. The proposed models are experimentally evaluated on case studies generated from two data sets publicly available in the archaeological literature. The obtained results show that the proposed data mining models are effective for detecting the sex of archaeological remains, confirming the potential of our proposal.},

	abstract = {Estimating age at death of cadavers is an important ability in various subfields of forensic science and bioarchaeology. It can allow investigators to pinpoint someone's identity, more accurately locate an event of interest in time and clarify other societal or legal issues concerning a given skeletal collection. There are two main categories of methods for estimating age at death: biochemical methods - which use various biological or chemical processes to obtain an estimation -, and mathematical methods - which employ the use of data mining tools such as regression in order to estimate age from various numerical features. In this paper, we propose two machine learning approaches for the age estimation problem and prove that they outperform existing mathematical approaches on a number of case studies derived from publicly available data used for this task. Moreover, our methods are more robust and easier to reuse on new data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. It involves the statistical inference of models (such as classifiers) from data. It is often conceived in a very impersonal way, with algorithms working autonomously on passively collected data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, and even deciding what should be modeled in the first place. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognising this human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the coadaptation of humans and systems. A humancentered understanding of machine learning in human context can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of framing learning computationally. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss these issues and suggest future research questions aimed at creating a human-centered approach to machine learning.},

We use an unmanned vehicle and other remote surveillance sensors, coupled with onboard pattern recognition algorithms, to perform a coarse search, and subsequently a fine search to identify structures of interest. We assume the availability of two sensors. The first sensor is a low resolution camera that sweeps an area of interest, such as an imaging satellite. We process the low-resolution image data to identify tentative locations of interest and to provide confidence estimates with this identification. This information is provided to a control algorithm for an unmanned air vehicle, which plans a trajectory to inspect closely promising objects subject to fuel constraints. These close inspections provide sequences of images that are combined to give 3-D reconstructions of the area of interest, leading to accurate classification of the structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the three principal algorithms in this system: machine learning processing of coarse resolution data, the near-optimal path planning subject to fuel constraints, and the high-resolution 3-D modeling from multiple 2-D views of a site. We illustrate the performance of our system on sample LANDSAT satellite data, and using a quadrotor with an on-board camera in a laboratory environment.},

You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage. . Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. Data Mining is the term used for knowledge discovery from large databases. The task of data mining is to make use of historical data, to discover regular patterns and improve future decisions, follows from the convergence of several recent trends: the lessening cost of large data storage devices and the everincreasing ease of collecting data over networks; the expansion of robust and efficient machine learning algorithms to process this data; and the lessening cost of computational power, enabling use of computationally intensive methods for data analysis. Machine learning, has already created practical applications in such areas as analyzing medical science outcomes, detecting fraud, detecting fake users etc. Various data mining classification approaches and machine learning algorithms are applied for prediction of chronic diseases. The objective of this research work is to introduce a new decision support system to predict chronic kidney disease. The aim of this work is to compare the performance of Support vector machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier on the basis of its accuracy, precision and execution time for CKD prediction. From the experimental results it is observed that the performance of KNN classifier is better than SVM.},

	abstract = {In the past twenty years, skeletal part profiles, which are prone to equifinality, have not occupied a prominent role in the interpretation of early Pleistocene sites on Africa. Alternatively, taphonomic studies on bone surface modifications and bone breakage patterns, have provided heuristic interpretations of some of the best preserved archaeological record of this period; namely, the Olduvai Bed I sites. The most recent and comprehensive taphonomic study of these sites (Dominguez-Rodrigo et al., 2007a) showed that FLK Zinj was an anthropogenic assemblage in which hominins acquired carcasses via primary access. That study also showed that the other sites were palimpsests with minimal or no intervention by hominins. The FLK N, FLK NN and DK sequence seemed to be dominated by single-agent (mostly, felid) or multiple-agent (mostly, felid-hyenid) processes. The present study re-analyzes the Bed I sites focusing on skeletal part profiles. Machine learning methods, which incorporate complex algorithms, are powerful predictive and classification methods and have the potential to better extract information from skeletal part representation than past approaches. Here, multiple algorithms (via decision trees, neural networks, random forests and support vector machines) are combined to produce a solid interpretation of bone accumulation agency at the Olduvai Bed I sites. This new approach virtually coincides with previous taphonomic interpretations on a site by site basis and shows that felids were dominant accumulating agents over hyenas during Bed I times. The recent discovery of possibly a modern lion-accumulated assemblage at Olduvai Gorge (Arriaza et al., submitted) provides a very timely analog for this interpretation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

fi eldwork reports (the ‘grey literature’) to synthetic journal articles. However, the indexing
and analysis of these documents can be time consuming and lacks consistency when done
by hand. It is also rarely integrated with the wider archaeological information domain,
and bibliographic searches have to be undertaken independently of database queries. Text
mining offers a means of extracting information from large volumes of text, providing
researchers with an easy way of locating relevant texts and also of identifying patterns
in the literature. In recent years, techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
its subfi eld, Information Extraction (IE), have been adopted to allow researchers to fi nd,
compare and analyse relevant documents, and to link them to other types of data. This
chapter introduces the underpinning mathematics and provides a short presentation of
the algorithms used, from the point of view of artifi cial intelligence and computational
logic. It describes the different NLP schools of thought and compares the pros and cons
of rule-based vs. machine learning approaches to IE. The role of ontologies and namedentity recognition is discussed and the chapter demonstrates how IE can provide the basis
for semantic annotation and how it contributes to the construction of a semantic web
for archaeology. The authors have worked on a number of projects that have employed
techniques from NLP and IE in Archaeology, including Archaeotools, STAR and STELLAR

	abstract = {In this work, data fusion of multi-element XRF results from archaeological feature soils and regional background soils was applied to assess the complementary value of geochemistry and machine-learning on predictive modelling in archaeology. Our principal aim was to integrate multiple data sources, train learning models for classification of archaeological soils and background soils, and compare model predictions for three validation areas with current archaeological interpretation and established predictive models. This was done using three supervised machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and artificial neural networks) which were trained, cross-validated and tested. The validation areas included a high archaeological potential area (n = 247 samples), the Dutch province of Zeeland (n = 261 samples) and an excavated imprint of an ancient farmhouse (n = 38 samples). The predictive models showed good overall performance and correctly classified about 95\% of all test instances. According to the learning models, the first validation site has a top soil horizon that shows limited parallels with archaeological horizons used in model training, whereas features of high archaeological probability become more apparent below this horizon. This is in good correspondence with geochemical depth profiles and current archaeological interpretation. As for the second validation site, the models highlighted several archaeological hotspots that to some extend spatially coincide with areas of high archaeological potential as indicated by established predictive modelling. Reversely, the classifiers attributed high archaeological potential status to the most southern region of Zeeland, thereby complementing established modelling results. For the third validation site none of the instances were correctly classified and these results clearly show the limitations of geochemical predictive modelling of significantly different soil types (fine-to-coarse sands) compared to the training set (clayey sands). Present proof-of-concept study shows that modelling of multiple-source geochemical soil data using machine-learning algorithms can be successfully accomplished and that model predictions nicely complement current interpretation and/or established archeological predictive modelling of areas of archaeological interest. Limitations of our approach were found to reside in lithological differences between sites used for model training and prediction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Museum professionals all over the world have always shown great interest in acquiring automatic methods to register and analyse the shape of cultural heritage artefacts. Thanks to recent advances in 3D scanning and photogrammetry techniques, it is now possible to model the surface of objects with very little effort and in a relatively short time. 
The continuous adoption of these techniques in cultural institutions has generated thousands if not millions of 3D digital models. Unfortunately, after these resources are produced, very little effort is spent in making them accessible to researchers or the general public. Part of the problem is a lack of efficient computer mechanisms to search, retrieve and classify 3D data.
The conventional way to search and retrieve 3D models consists in composing a query based on text descriptions. However, textual annotations are necessarily constrained by the database application domain, ontology, etc., as well as by language and other factors. Consequently they are inadequate for shape oriented searches.
This paper presents results of an on-going project focused on developing a computer platform to automatize the search, retrieval, recognition and analysis of 3D object models. The platform processes queries based on geometric properties instead of text. Simply stated, the computer program takes a 3D surface mesh as input (i.e. the query model). Then, a search engine compares it to hundreds or even thousands of 3D scanned objects stored in a repository identifying those that approximate the shape of the query model. Next, the matching models are retrieved, ranked by degree of similarity and displayed to the final user. Afterwards, additional tools can be deployed to perform some kind of analysis on the objects retrieved.
A platform like this is much more powerful than a text search engine because it avoids mismatching situations, such as when a person queries the database looking up for “bowls” and retrieves nothing just because the bowls are labelled as “cuencos” (a Spanish term) or “cajetes” (i.e. a term common in Mesoamerican archaeology to described the same type of vessels). Moreover, the platform is able to exploit mathematical analysis algorithms for automatic classification of shapes.
During the presentation, we discuss the specific requirements that a shape recognition platform must satisfy to be useful in museums and cultural heritage research. In archaeological projects, for example, we encounter objects that are not necessarily identical in terms of geometry and yet they are considered to belong to the same class. We also intent to show the first part of this platform, namely the search engine for matching and retrieval of 3D Objects.},

Subsequently, it simplifies the problem the RL agent is addressing, creating a more stable system. The Episodic Natural Actor Critic (ENAC) RL algorithm is used due to the continuous input and output domains and for the natural actor critic's convergence properties. Adaptiveness of the system is presented in a thruster failure scenario. RL is used in this failure scenario to learn an appropriate policy for the behaviours' weights under the new vehicle dynamics.

	abstract = {Velarde Square is located in the center of the present city of Santander and is one of its emblematic squares. Its location registers within what is considered the city walls of the medieval town, although until today there was no physical evidence of this wall in this zone. The archaeological site consists of 450 m2 of the southeast corner of the square Intended Annex the portico space defined by the current building of the tax office space. The dimensions of the space that was allocated to the archaeological excavation consists of a rectangle of 30 meters northbound length and 15 meters in width westward from said corner of the square. The existence of a square in this space do not coincide at all with the urban morphology of the site in medieval times, because this area was deeply affected by the remodeling suffered by urban center Santander history after the fire occurred in 1941. In order to document all the structures that were appearing in the archaeological site, it was decided to use convergent photogrammetry techniques from digital camera images taken from a drone.},

These programs address research issues and needs which could not be tackled without the availability of digital 3d models, thus broadening the horizons of archaeological research. To date, these methods and applications have been applied successfully to more than 30,000 pottery fragments, 3,000 stone tools, and many other archaeological finds submitted by more than 100 expeditions. This level of integration provides daily verification of the 3d approach and its intellectual and economical advantages.},

	title = {New frontiers in galactic archaeology: spectroscopic surveys, carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, and machine learning applications},
	abstract = {Large spectroscopic surveys are trailblazing endeavours in the study of stellar archaeology and near field cosmology. Access to homogeneous databases of thousands of stellar spectra allow for a detailed and statistically satisfying look into the chemical abundance distribution of our Galaxy and its surrounding satellites, ultimately working towards a better understanding of galactic chemical evolution. This thesis presents the work of three new studies at the current frontier of stellar archaeology. Through the first look at carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars using H-band spectra, six new CEMP stars and another seven likely candidates were found within the APOGEE database following Data Release 12. These stars have chemical compositions typical of metal-poor halo stars, however the α-abundances of two stars indicate possible origins in an accreted dwarf galaxy. A lack of heavy element spectral lines impedes further sub-classification of these CEMP stars, however, based on radial velocity scatter, we predict most are not CEMP-s stars which are typically found in binary systems. This preliminary investigation warrants optical observations to confirm the stellar parameters and low metallicities of these stars, to determine the heavy-element abundance ratios and improve the precision in the derived abundances, and to examine their CEMP sub-classifications. Additionally, the first results for the spectroscopic follow up to the Pristine survey are presented. Using a sample of 149 stars, a success rate of 70\% for finding stars with [Fe/H] ≤ −2.5 and 22\% for finding stars with [Fe/H] ≤ −3.0 is reported, significantly higher than other surveys that typically report success rates of 3-4\% for recovering stars with [Fe/H] ≤ −3.0. Finally, the new spectral analysis tool StarNet is introduced. A deep neural network architecture is used to examine both synthetic stellar spectra and SDSS-III APOGEE spectral data and can produce the stellar parameters of temperature, gravity, and metallicity with similar or better precision as the APOGEE pipeline values when trained directly with the APOGEE spectra. StarNet is capable of being trained on synthetic data as well, and is able to reproduce the stellar parameters for both synthetic and APOGEE spectra, including low signal-to-noise spectra, with similar precision to training on the APOGEE spectra itself. The residuals between StarNet predictions and APOGEE DR13 parameters are similar to or better than the differences between the APOGEE DR13 results and optical high resolution spectral analyses for a subset of benchmark stars. While developed using the APOGEE spectral database (real spectra and corresponding ASSET synthetic data with similar normalization functions), StarNet should be applicable to other large spectroscopic surveys like Pristine.},

Sexual identity has previously been manually determined by measuring the ratios of the lengths of the individual’s fingers as well as by using other physical features. Most conventional studies measure the lengths manually and thus are often constrained by the lack of scaling information on published images. We have created a method that determines sex by applying modern machine-learning techniques to relative measures obtained from images of human hands. This is the first known attempt at substituting automated methods for time-consuming manual measurement in the study of sexual identities of prehistoric cave artists. Our study provides quantitative evidence relevant to sexual dimorphism and the sexual division of labor in Upper Paleolithic societies. In addition to analyzing historical handprint records, this method has potential applications in criminal forensics and human-computer interaction.},

In this paper, we develop a greatly improved archaeological predictive model \$APM\_\{enhanced\}\$ that predicts where archaeological sites will be found. This approach is applied to remotely-sensed multispectral bands and a single topographical band obtained from advanced remote sensing technologies such as satellites and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS). Our \$APM\_\{enhanced\}\$ is composed of band transformation, image analysis, feature extraction and classification. We evaluate our methodology on the sensor bands over Ft.Irwin, CA, USA. A nested bi-loop cross-validation and receiver operating characteristics curves are used to assess the performance of our algorithm. We first validate our method on the east swath of Ft.Irwin and then test on a separate dataset from the west swath of Ft.Irwin. A convex combination of two methodologies: \$APM\_\{conventional\}\$, which has been used among archaeologists for many years, and our \$APM\_\{enhanced\}\$, is demonstrated to yield superior classification performance compared to either alone at low false negative rates. We compare the performance of our methodology on different band combinations, chosen based on the archaeological importance for these sensor bands. We also compare the two types of \$APM\$s in the aspects of input data, output values, practicality and transferability.},

Instead of tracking fiducial markers, we track natural keypoints, during which the point correspondences are established from the classification perspective. The tracking range is able to be extended by employing many reference images. These results in a promising algorithm that successfully tested on a touring guide system, which provides views of virtual original appearance superimposed to ruins of Yuanmingyuan archaeological site of China. Comparisons are also made between ARToolkit and the proposed algorithm in indoor environment.

Traffic classification based on machine learning could provide a solution. By training a classifier using representative traffic samples, we can classify (and differentiate between) distinct, but possibly similar, applications of interest in previously anonymised trace files. Using popular peer-to-peer and online game applications as examples, we show that their traffic flows can be separated after-the-fact without using port numbers or packet payload.

A solution configuration consist of which operators to use with what activation probabilities, a selection policy, a fitness mapping policy, an initial population size and a cut condition. The result produced is a collection of individuals with phenotypical and genotypical values that optimize the fitness/evaluation function until the cut condition is fulfilled.

Firstly, the mesh model and the bump map are used to construct the clay pit-based model. The calculation process is completed by the GPU, and the real-time performance is obviously improved. Then, the posture and inclination of the shovel are continuously adjusted, and obtain a set of different three-dimensional modules that intersect the shovel and pit-based models to determine the mining area. Secondly, combined with the blanking algorithm, the set of intersecting modules is eliminated, and a series of visual effects excavated are displayed to improve the three-dimensional display effect. Finally, the particle system is used for modeling to realize the special effect of soil dust around the excavation. The effectiveness of the system is proved in the experimental simulation.},

"Digital protection" of cultural heritage is a new way of protection, relying on computer technology, and the use of digital equipment to collect, save, process, output and disseminate the required information, including databases established on computer systems, So as to achieve the purpose of information sharing and dissemination. This article mainly studies the application research of virtual reality technology in the digital preservation of cultural heritage. Create an immersive environment for users, display the objects realistically in the virtual reality system, thereby digitizing the technical protection of cultural heritage; secondly, use the virtual environment model of material cultural protection to build and use the terrain to generate and edit The device imitates the terrain of the natural world to achieve its position and the effect of being in it. Finally, the radial basis function is used to calculate the value in the virtual environment, so that the digital preservation of cultural heritage is more accurate. Experimental data shows that 35.54\% and 64.46\% of users are more likely to use the handle to interact with three-dimensional objects. They believe that the speed of the handle has changed and the control is more precise. Experimental results show that: The virtual environment reality technology specification is more efficient than the original technology in the process of digitizing cultural heritage.},

Different from most classical low-level image segmentation methods that are known to be very sensitive to the noise and occlusions, we propose a new supervised learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to implicitly learn and utilize more curve geometry and pattern information for addressing this challenging problem. More specifically, we first propose a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to estimate the skeleton of curve structures and at each skeleton pixel, a scale value is estimated to reflect the local curve width. Then we propose a dense prediction network to refine the estimated curve skeletons. Based on the estimated scale values, we finally develop an adaptive thresholding algorithm to achieve the final segmentation of curve structures. In the experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of depth images scanned from unearthed pottery sherds dating to the Woodland period of Southeastern North America.},

	isbn = {1934-3221},
	abstract = {Framing a collective identity is an essential process in a social movement. The identity defines the orientation of public actions to take and establishes an informal interaction network for circulating important information and material resources. While domestic social movements emphasize the coherence of identity in alliance, global or cyber-activism is now flexible in its collective identity given the rise of the Internet. A campaign may include diverse social movement organizations (SMOs) with different social agendas. This flexible identity framing encourages personal involvement in direct action. On the other hand, it may damage solidarity within SMOs and make campaigns difficult to control. To assess the sustainability of an SMO, it is important to understand its collective identity and the social codes embedded within its associated cyber-societies and cyber-artifacts. In this study, we took a cyber-archeology approach and used the international Falun Gong (FLG) movement as a case study to investigate this identity-framing issue. We employed social network analysis and Writeprint to analyze FLG's cyber-artifacts from the perspectives of links, web content, and forum content. In the link analysis, FLG's websites linked closely to Chinese democracy and human rights SMOs, reflecting FLG's historical conflicts with the Chinese government after the official ban in 1999. In the web content analysis, we used Writeprint to analyze the writings of Hongzhi Li and of his editors, and found that Hongzhi Li's writings center around the ideological teaching of Falun Dafa while the editors post specific programs to realize Li's teaching. In the forum content analysis, FLG comprehensively organizes several different concepts on a continuum: from FLG ideology to life philosophy and mysterious phenomena, and from mysterious phenomena to anti-Chinese Communist Party and persecution by conceptualizing the Chinese government as the Evil. By deploying those cyber-artifacts, FLG seamlessly connects different ideologies and establishes its identity as a Qi-Gong, religious, and activist group.},

	abstract = {This article responds to technofeminist calls to unpack the gendered politics of technologies and create critical crossover between their representation and design. I analyze feminized artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, Cortana) in light of two science-fiction narratives: Tomorrow's Eve, a Victorian novel; and Her, a postmillennial film. Each story exemplifies a pivotal moment in media history: Eve the transition from symbolic to technical media; Her the transition from technical to computational media. Both stories depict a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent, feminized version of the communication media du jour. Whereas Eve and Her operate on our imaginary, Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are by our side every day, naturalizing contingent gender divisions. I address three questions: what is the cultural work accomplished by feminized AI? Which boundaries are coming down or built up? What gendered relations are (re)produced? Drawing on media archaeology, critical theory, gender studies, and media theory, this article argues the association of femininity with technology sustains differences across three dimensions: docile labour, replaceable embodiment, and artificial intelligence. This triadic framework weaves together analytic threads that often remain separate to develop a nuanced critique of femininity as a mode for domesticating new technology and technology as materializing gender relations. The discussion extends the framework to a more generalized analysis of AI as a problematic prescription for how we become machine-shaped. I advance an entangled reinterpretation of the Turing Test and suggest ethics, aesthetics, and performativity as key sites of intervention in rethinking AI design to include rather than exclude multiple forms of difference. The conclusion offers the framework as a novel heuristic for intersectional, nonreductive critiques of technology and difference.},

The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them. One of the challenges in recent years is the automatic analysis of collected information. This paper introduces a novel approach to protecting Buildings using Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), which leverages a sensor network and Deep Learning techniques to analyze sensor data. A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.},

	abstract = {Flow familiar were the pre-Homeric Greeks with Egyptian technology'? Accounts of apparent mythological nature and archaeological evidence indicate cultural contacts. To what extent did Greek craftsmen learn their ail from Egyptians? At excavations in Djoser's pyramid (3rd dynasty, ca. 2750 13C) sonic 36000 glazed tiles were found. most with a turqoise-blue glaze coating but also many with other colours. The glazing process has been interpreted as a self-glazing process involving alkali salts, copper oxide (CuO) and firing temperatures of around 850 degrees C. One investigation (Schiegel, 1988) indicated that this glaze was composed mainly of quartz, tenorite and water with a minor amount of alkalis, iron. phosphorus and chlorine. The interpretation of the data as indicative of the presence of chemically bound water is rather puzzling if such high temperatures were indeed used to produce the,laze oil these tiles, and in such large quantities.An alternative explanation has been proposed (Davidovits, 2005) according to which what is needed in order to replicate this self-glazing process is soluble silicate SiO2, K2O, Na2O + synthetic turquoise (inafkat), aluminium phosphate hydrate + copper phosphate hydrate and a firing temperature of 250'C. The resulting glaze call be described its it geopolynier-type material where the vitrified matfix is (K, Na)-Poly(Sialate-decaSiloxo), (Si-O-Al-O)-(Si-O-) 10. The process call be controlled to produce blue (K+) or green (Na+) at 250'C or black at 350'C in the presence of Cu-phosphate, Cu-silicate and tenorite, or beige in the presence of' Fe-salts (phosphate, arsenate). The process results in a vitreous matrix with the appearance of a fitience-type material and with a composition corresponding to the starting materials. We have used a number of techniques to characterise this turqUoise-blue --copolymer glaze" produced experimentally by Davidovits. Synchrotron-XRD of'sinall flakes front the outer blue surface layer and the white inner core was used to determine the \%weight ofthe diffracting phases as well as the amorphous component which constitutes some 87\% ofthe scattering mass. SEM/EDS was employed to study the vitreous matrix morphology as well as the local elemental composition. Raman spectroscopy was used to correlate the other observations with the Molecular composition of the areas examined. It is an appealing thought, that ancient craftsmen were as ingenious in matters of solid state chemistry and metallurgy as present-day industrial materials scientists. Could similar skills have been used for decorating metal obJects such its mentioned in the Homeric epics, particularly when referring to Hephaestian arts? Why not? Whitt else could the Greeks have learned from the wiseold Egyptians, a mature and technologically advanced civilisation well before Homeric times'?},

Since PCA and cluster analysis based on Euclidean distances are scale dependent, some kind of "appropriate" data transformation is necessary. Some different techniques of data preparation will be presented. We consider the log-ratio transformation of Aitchison and the transformation into ranks in more detail. From the statistical point of view the latter is a robust method.},

Since the number of possible 3D configurations is considerably large, the exhaustive manual trial may result in abrasion on fractured surfaces and even failure to find the correct matches. As a result, many recent works suggest virtual reassembly from 3D scans of the fragments. The problem is challenging in the view of the conventional 3D geometric analysis, as it is hard to extract reliable shape features from the thin break lines. We propose to optimize for the global configuration by combining geometric constraints with information from noisy shape features. Specifically, we enforce bijection and continuity of sequence of correspondences given estimates of corners and pair-wise matching scores between multiple break lines. We demonstrate that our pipeline greatly increases the accuracy of correspondences, resulting in stable restoration of 3D configurations from irregular and noisy evidence.},

In this paper, we propose building principles of hierarchical knowledge, and identify different types of relations between categories (same relation, proper including relation, intersectional relation, compatible and parallel relation, disparate relation, contradicted relation, and opposite relation), and present an approach to evaluate the correctness of hierarchal knowledge based on different types of attributes of categories. We also address an application of this approach to building and evaluating the hierarchical knowledge of archaeological domain.},

	isbn = {1051-4651},
	abstract = {A heretofore unsolved problem of great archaeological importance is the automatic assembly, of pots made on a wheel from the hundreds (or thousands) of sherds found at an excavation site. An approach is presented to the automatic estimation of mathematical models of such pots from 3D measurements of sherds. A Bayesian approach is formulated beginning with a description of the complete set of geometric parameters that determine the distribution of the sherd measurement data. Matching of fragments and aligning them geometrically into configurations is based on matching break-curves (curves on a pot surface separating fragments), estimated axis and profile curve pairs for individual fragments and configurations of fragments, and a number of features of groups of break-curves. Pot assembly, is a bottom-up maximum likelihood performance-based search. Experiments are illustrated on pots which were broken for the purpose, and on sherds from an archaeological dig located in Petra, Jordan. The performance measure can also be an aposteriori probability, and many other types of information can be included, e.g., pot wall thickness, surface color, patterns on the surface, etc. This can also be viewed as the problem of learning a geometric object from an unorganized set of free-form fragments of the object and of clutter, or as a problem of perceptual grouping.},

Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations.},

The kernel-based extreme learning machine (ELM) is utilized to preprocess the original data and restore the missing parts. Then a new non-uniform sampling time-frequency representation (TFR) is proposed to analyze the non-stationary characteristic of restored data from a signal processing perspective. The test data is the real environment monitoring data of the burial pit at the Yang Mausoleum of the Han dynasty.

From this perspective, understanding the trophic pressure between hominins and carnivores can provide valuable insights into the context in which humans survived, interacted with their surroundings, and consequently evolved. While numerous techniques already exist for the detection of carnivore activity in archaeological and palaeontological sites, many of these techniques present important limitations. The present study builds on a number of advanced data science techniques to confront these issues, defining methods for the identification of the precise agents involved in carcass consumption and manipulation. For the purpose of this study, a large sample of 620 carnivore tooth pits is presented, including samples from bears, hyenas, jaguars, leopards, lions, wolves, foxes and African wild dogs. Using 3D modelling, geometric morphometrics, robust data modelling, and artificial intelligence algorithms, the present study obtains between 88 and 98\% accuracy, with balanced overall evaluation metrics across all datasets. From this perspective, and when combined with other sources of taphonomic evidence, these results show that advanced data science techniques can be considered a valuable addition to the taphonomist's toolkit for the identification of precise carnivore agents via tooth pit morphology.},

This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning.

We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.},

	abstract = {Why archaeological artefacts are the way they are? In this paper we try to solve such a question by investigating the relationship between form and function. We propose new ways of studying the way behaviour in the past can be asserted on the examination of archaeological observables in the present. In any case, we take into account that there are also non-visual features characterizing ancient objects and materials (i.e., compositional information based on mass spectrometry data, chronological information based on radioactive decay measurements, etc.). Information that should make us aware of many functional properties of objects is multidimensional in nature: size, which makes reference to height, length, depth, weight and mass; shape and form, which make reference to the geometry of contours and volumes; texture, which refers to the microtopography (roughness, waviness, and lay) and visual appearance (colour variations, brightness, reflectivity and transparency) of surfaces; and finally material, meaning the combining of distinct compositional elements and properties to form a whole. With the exception of material data, the other relevant aspects for functional reasoning have been traditionally described in rather ambiguous terms, without taking into account the advantages of quantitative measurements of shape/form, and texture. Reasoning about the functionality of archaeological objects recovered at the archaeological site requires a cross-disciplinary investigation, which may also range from recognition techniques used in computer vision and robotics to reasoning, representation, and learning methods in artificial intelligence. The approach we adopt here is to follow current computational theories of object perception to ameliorate the way archaeology can deal with the explanation of human behaviour in the past (function) from the analysis of visual and non-visual data, taking into account that visual appearances and even compositional characteristics only constrain the way an object may be used, but never fully determine it.},

Using mathematical, physical, and artificial intelligence methods, some researchers in computational biology focused on uncovering the evolutionary ages of proteins according to present PPI networks (PINs), but improving their accuracy was challenging. A plausible explanation is that they solved biological problems with non-biological techniques and did not provide much attention to biological backgrounds and meanings of proteins or their relationships. In this paper, we propose two ways to improve the accuracy of age predicting and skillfully "embedding" multi source biological information in each iteration of an archaeology algorithm for yeast PIN. On the one hand, we reduce the probability of reversing errors by decreasing the non-duplication protein pairs, which are obtained from 460 gene trees constructed by means of a multiple sequence alignment and the neighbor joining algorithm. On the other hand, the reliable crossover standard from different biological information sources can decrease local random errors of alternative treatment. The application of the novel algorithm to simulation data and real yeast PINs shows a marked improvement in accuracy. Our research strongly suggests that putting non-biological methods into the "biological context" will bear more favorable results.},

We try to develop an integrated system for archaeological 3D survey and all other types of archaeological data and knowledge by incorporating observable (material) and non-graphic (interpretive) data. Survey plays a central role, since it is both a metric representation of the archaeological site and, to a wider extent, an interpretation of it (being also a common basis for communication between the two teams). More specifically, 3D survey is crucial, allowing archaeologists to connect actual spatial assets to the stratigraphic formation processes (i.e., to the archaeological time) and to translate spatial observations into historical interpretation of the site. It is well known that laser scanner, photogrammetry and computer vision are very useful tools for archaeologists, although the integration of the representation of space, as well as archaeological time has not yet found a methodological standard of reference. We propose a common formalism for describing photogrammetric survey and archaeological knowledge stemming from ontologies: indeed, ontologies are fully used to model and store 3D data and archaeological knowledge. We equip this formalism with a qualitative representation of time, starting from archaeological stratigraphy. Stratigraphic analyses (both of excavated deposits and of upstanding structures) are closely related to Edward Cecil Harris's theory of the "Unit of Stratigraphication" (referred to as "US", while a stratigraphic unit of an upstanding structure Unita Stratigrafica Murale, in Italian, will be referred to as "USM"). Every US is connected to the others by geometric, topological and, eventually, temporal links, and these are recorded by the 3D photogrammetric survey. However, the limitations of the Harris matrix approach led us to use another formalism for representing stratigraphic relationships, namely Qualitative Constraints Networks (QCN), which was successfully used in the domain of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence for representing temporal relations.},

	abstract = {Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and common millet (Panicum miliaceum) were important staple crops for the inhabitants of northern China since the Neolithic. The near exclusive consumption of these millets results in extremely elevated bulk collagen delta C-13 values (similar to-7 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand), which serve as natural isotopic tracers in palaeodiet studies. Here we report individual amino acid delta C-13 results (delta C-13(AA)) for humans (n = 12) and animals (n = 9) that consumed varying amounts of millets at the Proto-Shang period (2000-1600 BC) site of Nancheng, China. Using established delta C-13(AA) proxies (Delta C-13(Gly-Phe), Delta C-13(val-Phe), and plots of delta C-13(phe) vs. delta C-13(val), delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(Giy-phe), and delta C-13(Lys) vs. Delta C-13(va1-phe)) and machine learning assisted principal component analysis (MLA-PCA), we compared the Nancheng data to published known archaeological C-3, C-4, marine and freshwater protein consumers. Exclusive millet-consuming humans and animals from Nancheng displayed highly C-13-enriched amino acid results, which were distinct from C-4 consumers of maize (Zea mays) in the Americas. Compared to delta C-13(AA) dietary proxies, MLA-PCA provides improved separation for all of the different dietary categories reviewed. Further, this method was able to distinguish additional dietary details, such as identifying brackish species. Increased application of MLA-PCA in palaeodiet research utilizing delta C-13(AA) measurements could create regional and global aminoisoscapes that can reveal unique dietary and environmental information that is otherwise hidden by bulk and existing delta C-13(AA) proxy isotopic analyses.},

	abstract = {The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) method with the standard constant-offset reflection mode allows to detect and map different types of archaeological structures, such as walls, foundations, floors and roads. The interpretation of the GPR data usually involves a detailed and time-consuming analysis of large amounts of information, which entails nonnegligible chances of errors, especially under nonideal fieldwork conditions. The application of suitable automatic detection algorithms can be useful to more rapidly and successfully complete the interpretation task. In this work, we explore the use of supervised machine learning methodologies to automatically detect mud-wall signatures in radargrams and to map the structures from these detections. Several algorithms, based on Viola-Jones cascade classifiers and the image feature descriptors Haar, histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns, were implemented. These algorithms were applied to datasets previously acquired in pre-Inca and Inca-Hispanic sites located in the Andean NW region of Argentina. The best algorithms provided very good detection rates for well-preserved walls and acceptable rates for deteriorated walls, with a low number of spurious predictions. They also exhibited the ability to detect collapsed walls and fragments detached from them. These are remarkable results because mud walls are usually difficult to be detected by conventional analysis, owing to the complex and variable characteristics of their reflection patterns. The results of the automatic detection techniques were represented in plan views and three-dimensional (3D) views that delineated in detail most of the structures of the sites. These algorithms are very fast, so applying them significantly reduces the interpretation times. In addition, once they have been trained using the patterns of one or several sites, they are directly applicable to other sites with similar characteristics.},

The most common method of  analyzing untargeted proteomics data is called database searching, where the  database is simply a collection of protein sequences from the target organism,  derived from genome sequencing. Experimental peptide tandem mass spectra are  compared to simplified models of theoretical spectra calculated from the  translated genomic sequences. However, in several interesting application areas,  such as forensics, archaeology, venomics, and others, a genome sequence may not  be available, or the correct genome sequence to use is not known. In these cases,  de novo peptide identification can play an important role. De novo methods infer  peptide sequence directly from the tandem mass spectrum without reference to a  sequence database, usually using graph-based or machine learning algorithms. In  this review, we provide a basic overview of de novo peptide identification  methods and applications, briefly covering de novo algorithms and tools, and  focusing in more depth on recent applications from venomics, metaproteomics,  forensics, and characterization of antibody drugs.},

We developed a pre-screening protocol  based on attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier-transform infrared  spectroscopy (FTIR) for assessing the chemical composition and mineralogy of  ancient bone samples. METHODS: ATR-FTIR measurements were performed on bulk bones  of diverse origin and age before collagen extraction. The percentage nitrogen of  bulk bones, as well as the weight percentage, and the percentage carbon and  nitrogen of extracted organic matter were noted. Several machine learning  algorithms were applied to the spectral data and compared for their efficacy in  screening for well preserved collagen. RESULTS: The results showed that (a) the  first derivative of the spectral data was better suited to screening than the raw  FTIR data, especially for a wider spectral range and (b) certain classification  algorithms [e.g. gradient boosting machine (GBM)] were able to efficiently  predict the degree of preservation in bone samples. CONCLUSIONS: This  pre-screening protocol can serve as a fast, concise and inexpensive pre-screening  tool for determining relative degrees of preservation before collagen extraction  and subsequent (14) C dating. The screening power based on the machine learning  techniques can be further improved by accumulating the FTIR spectral data of  bones.},

The diverse cultural history, highly variable physiographic environments, archaeological site data inconsistencies, and limited available model variable data provided challenges.

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach. Moreover, we exploited the fusion of LiDAR and image-based point clouds towards addressing challenges of both modalities in problematic areas.},

	abstract = {Despite its theoretical importance, the process of stone tool-making skill acquisition remains understudied and poorly understood. The challenges and costs of skill learning constitute an oft-neglected factor in the evaluation of alternative adaptive strategies and a potential source of bias in cultural transmission. Similarly, theory and data indicate that the most salient neural and cognitive demands of stone tool-making should occur during learning rather than expert performance. Unfortunately, the behavioral complexity and extensive learning requirements that make stone knapping skill acquisition an interesting object of study are the very features that make it so challenging to investigate experimentally. Here we present results from a multidisciplinary study of Late Acheulean handaxe-making skill acquisition involving twenty-six naive participants and up to 90 hours training over several months, accompanied by a battery of psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments. In this initial report, we derive a robust quantitative skill metric for the experimental handaxes using machine learning algorithms, reconstruct a group-level learning curve, and explore sources of individual variation in learning outcomes. Results identify particular cognitive targets of selection on the efficiency or reliability of tool-making skill acquisition, quantify learning costs, highlight the likely importance of social support, motivation, persistence, and self-control in knapping skill acquisition, and illustrate methods for reliably reconstructing ancient learning processes from archaeological evidence.

Several of these archaeological sites have yielded numerous hominin fossils and traces of their activities, thus offering invaluable insights into the nature and origins of human behavior. Nevertheless, certain taphonomic discussions that have been of great importance for the study of the South African cave sites have remained unnoticed in East Africa. One of these issues revolves around the interpretation of Paranthropus as a common prey of predators. In this paper, we analyze the postcranial remains of OH80, a partial skeleton of a Paranthropus boisei discovered at the BK site (Bell Korongo, Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) in 2010. Some of the specimens of this skeleton have been reported to show surface modifications tentatively associated to the action of carnivores. Here, several pits observed on OH80-12, the Paranthropus boisei femur, were digitally reconstructed and analyzed through geometric morphometrics to determine the nature of the marks. The OH80-12 marks are compared with a modern sample of percussion marks and several carnivore tooth pits, since the action of both agents has previously been identified at the site and can sometimes result in equifinality problems. Alongside already published geometric morphometric tests, here we present a very newly developed approach based on the combination of geometric morphometric data and the training of machine learning algorithms. Both methodologies highlight that OH80 was consumed by carnivores, being a felid the most likely modifying agent.},

The association of heterogeneous information to 3D data by means of automated segmentation and classification methods can help to characterize, describe and better interpret the object under study. Indeed, the high complexity of 3D data along with the large diversity of heritage assets themselves have constituted segmentation and classification methods as currently active research topics. Although machine learning methods brought great progress in this respect, few advances have been developed in relation to cultural heritage 3D data. Starting from the existing literature, this paper aims to develop, explore and validate reliable and efficient automated procedures for the classification of 3D data (point clouds or polygonal mesh models) of heritage scenarios. In more detail, the proposed solution works on 2D data (texture-based approach) or directly on the 3D data (geometry-based approach) with supervised or unsupervised machine learning strategies. The method was applied and validated on four different archaeological/architectural scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is reliable and replicable and it is effective for restoration and documentation purposes, providing metric information e.g. of damaged areas to be restored.},

The issues mentioned in the previous thought frequently result in the program not satisfying the expectation of the stakeholders. In particular, for non-functional requirements, clients rarely emphasize these specifications as much as they might be justified. Identifying, classifying and reconciling the requirements is one of the main duty of the System Analyst, which without using a proper tool, can be very demanding and time-consuming. Tools which support text processing are expected to improve the accuracy of identification and classification of requirements even in an unstructured set of inputs. System Analysts can also use them in document archeology tasks where many documents, regulations, standards, etc. have to be processed. Methods elaborated in natural language processing and machine learning offer a solid basis. However, their usability and the possibility to improve the performance utilizing the specific knowledge from the domain of the software engineering are to be examined thoroughly.

The study of lithic assemblages collected at a deflation surface surrounded by stabilised sand dunes near the coastline, shows that wind produce significant corrasion (wind abrasion) of artefacts and affects preservation of small and medium size artefacts. The sample is mainly composed of chert knapping debitage with abraded and polished edges and surfaces. The artefact size distribution suggests that a subset of the assemblage exhibits good preservation, possibly due to the recent subaerial exposure. Furthermore, carbonate and mould coatings were recorded over the artefacts surface in contact with the ground, which indicates the presence of humid conditions in the sand dunes deflation area. In order to explore the factors that affected assemblage stability conditions in the locus, a machine learning based decision tree was applied. The model predicts and defines a threshold at which the occurrence of instability conditions may appear. Also, it suggests that relative altitude of artefacts within the deflation hollow is the primary variable explaining the exposure conditions recorded in the artefacts and it points out processes of differential deflation over time. The data presented here illustrates how wind alters local surface materials and emphasizes that a taphonomic perspective is needed to assess the formation processes within northern Patagonia coastal archaeological assemblages.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.08.003},
	abstract = {We define tephras and cryptotephras and their components (mainly ash-sized particles of glass crystals in distal deposits) and summarize the basis of tephrochronology as a chronostratigraphic correlational and dating tool for palaeoenvironmental, geological, and archaeological research. We then document and appraise recent advances in analytical methods used to determine the major, minor, and trace elements of individual glass shards from tephra or cryptotephra deposits to aid their correlation and application. Protocols developed recently for the electron probe microanalysis of major elements in individual glass shards help to improve data quality and standardize reporting procedures. A narrow electron beam (diameter similar to 3-5 gm) can now be used to analyze smaller glass shards than previously attainable. Reliable analyses of 'microshards' (defined here as glass shards {\textless} 32 gm in diameter) using narrow beams are useful for fine-grained samples from distal or ultra-distal geographic locations, and for vesicular or microlite-rich glass shards or small melt inclusions. Caveats apply, however, in the microprobe analysis of very small microshards ({\textless}=similar to 5 gm in diameter), where particle geometry becomes important, and of microlite-rich glass shards where the potential problem of secondary fluorescence across phase boundaries needs to be recognised. Trace element analyses of individual glass shards using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), with crater diameters of 20 mu m and 10 mu m, are now effectively routine, giving detection limits well below 1 ppm. Smaller ablation craters ({\textless} 10 mu m) can be subject to significant element fractionation during analysis, but the systematic relationship of such fractionation with glass composition suggests that analyses for some elements at these resolutions may be quantifiable. In undertaking analyses, either by microprobe or LA-ICP-MS, reference material data acquired using the same procedure, and preferably from the same analytical session, should be presented alongside new analytical data.
In part 2 of the review, we describe, critically assess, and recommend ways in which tephras or cryptotephras can be correlated (in conjunction with other information) using numerical or statistical analyses of compositional data. Statistical methods provide a less subjective means of dealing with analytical data pertaining to tephra components (usually glass or crystalsiphenocrysts) than heuristic alternatives. They enable a better understanding of relationships among the data from multiple viewpoints to be developed and help quantify the degree of uncertainty in establishing correlations. In common with other scientific hypothesis testing, it is easier to infer using such analysis that two or more tephras are different rather than the same. Adding stratigraphic, chronological, spatial, or palaeoenvironmental data (i.e. multiple criteria) is usually necessary and allows for more robust correlations to be made. A two-stage approach is useful, the first focussed on differences in the mean composition of samples, or their range, which can be visualised graphically via scatterplot matrices or bivariate plots coupled with the use of statistical tools such as distance measures, similarity coefficients, hierarchical cluster analysis (informed by distance measures or similarity or cophenetic coefficients), and principal components analysis (PCA). Some statistical methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) are referred to as 'machine learning' in the computing literature. The second stage examines sample variance and the degree of compositional similarity so that sample equivalence or otherwise can be established on a statistical basis. This stage may involve discriminant function analysis (DFA), support vector machines (SVMs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), and ANOVA or MANOVA (or its two-sample special case, the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test). Randomization tests can be used where distributional assumptions such as multivariate normality underlying parametric tests are doubtful.
Compositional data may be transformed and scaled before being subjected to multivariate statistical procedures including calculation of distance matrices, hierarchical cluster analysis, and PCA. Such transformations may make the assumption of multivariate normality more appropriate. A sequential procedure using Mahalanobis distance and the Hotelling two-sample T-2 test is illustrated using glass major element data from trachytic to phonolitic Kenyan tephras. All these methods require a broad range of high-quality compositional data which can be used to compare 'unknowns' with reference (training) sets that are sufficiently complete to account for all possible correlatives, including tephras with heterogeneous glasses that contain multiple compositional groups. Currently, incomplete databases are tending to limit correlation efficacy. The development of an open, online global database to facilitate progress towards integrated, high-quality tephrostratigraphic frameworks for different regions is encouraged. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As the conditions for detecting the sex of a skeleton are not entirely known, machine learning based data mining models are appropriate to address this problem since they are able to capture unobservable patterns in data. These patterns could be relevant for classifying a skeletal remain as male or female. We propose two machine learning models based on artificial neural networks for identifying the sex of human skeletons from bone measurements. The proposed models are experimentally evaluated on case studies generated from two data sets publicly available in the archaeological literature. The obtained results show that the proposed data mining models are effective for detecting the sex of archaeological remains, confirming the potential of our proposal.},

In contrast with traditional 2D and 3D shape matching approaches, we introduce a set of feature descriptors that are based on not only color and shape, but also normal maps. These are easy to acquire and combine high data quality with discriminability and robustness to some types of deterioration. Our feature descriptors range from general-purpose to domain-specific, and are quick to compute and match. We have tested our system on three datasets of fresco fragments, demonstrating that multi-cue matching using different subsets of features leads to different tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we show that normal-based features are more effective than color-based ones at similar computational complexity, and that 3D features are more discriminative than ones based on 2D or normals, but at higher computational cost. We also demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to effectively combine our new features with traditional ones. Our results show good retrieval performance, significantly improving upon the match prediction rate of state-of-the-art 3D matching algorithms, and are expected to extend to general matching problems in applications such as texture synthesis and forensics.},

	abstract = {The spatial analysis of microdebitage (measuring less than 6.3 mm) can identify areas where stone tools were knapped at archaeological sites. These tiny artifacts tend to become embedded in the locations where they were first deposited and are less vulnerable to post-depositional movement, making microdebitage an important artifact class for identifying primary areas of stone tool production. Traditional microdebitage analysis, however, can take multiple hours spread over several days to complete. Because of this, microdebitage analysis is typically completed in very small areas of sites due to the intensive time and labor commitment required. Recently, however, my colleagues and I have developed a novel, interdisciplinary method that combines dynamic image analysis and machine learning to analyze microdebitage taken from soil samples at archaeological sites. Analyses of experimental microdebitage demonstrated that microdebitage could be accurately and efficiently identified within archaeological soil samples using this method. In the present study, we apply these methods to soil samples taken from the Maya Capital of Tamarindito in Guatemala to verify whether these methods remain accurate when applied to archaeological contexts.},

	abstract = {Ancient bronze is subject to complex degradation which can lead, in cases where copper chlorides are present, to a cyclic and self-sustaining degradation process commonly referred to as "bronze disease". If left untreated, bronze disease can eat away at a bronze object until it is entirely deteriorated. The presence of copper trihydroxychlorides is indicative that this process is underway and therefore the detection of these corrosion products is necessary in guiding conservation of ancient bronze artefacts. In this paper we present a high spatial/spectral resolution short wave infrared (SWIR) imaging solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides in ancient bronze, combining hyperspectral imaging with an in-house developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automated spectral clustering. For this work, verification was obtained through use of an in-house developed reference database of typical ancient bronze corrosion products from several archaeological sites, and from collections of the National Museum of China. This paper also explores the suitability, and limitations, of a visible to near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imaging system as a more accessible solution for mapping copper trihydroxychlorides associated with bronze disease. We suggest that our hyperspectral imaging solution can provide a non-invasive, rapid, and high resolution material mapping within and across bronze objects, particularly beneficial for analysing large collections in a museum setting.},

The geographical area where they are present is considerable, from the Aralo-Caspian zone to central-western Arabia. Always present, several elements make up the layout of the kites, which makes them singular constructions and identifies them. However, variations in shape or size are observed throughout their extension area. Using qualitative and quantitative variables obtained by observing a sample of kites (10\% of the total identified) on high-resolution satellite images, we propose a combination of exploratory statistical analysis, unsupervised machine learning approaches (PCA, clustering and association rules) and spatial analysis (neighbourhood) to establish a clustering of kites based on their morphological descriptions. This work allows to identify groups of kites sharing similar features, each of which is relatively circumscribed in geographic space. This regionalisation of morphologically homogeneous groups of kites could explain the temporality of the constructions while, despite recent fieldwork, dating is still rare.},

Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80\% of delta 15N parts per thousand and 66\% of delta 13C parts per thousand) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history.},

The recorded sites are  systematically pre-processed with regard to their chronology, functional  interpretation and spatial delineation.

The Random Forests machine learning algorithm is used to examine the impact of  terrain covariates on the depth of sites and pottery preservation. Neolithic  settlement dynamics are studied using Site Exploitation Territories, and site  frequencies per century are used to compare the intensity of land use with  adjacent landscapes. The results show that the main trends of the Neolithic  settlement dynamics can be derived from the dataset. However, Random Forests  analyses indicate poor pottery preservation in the Central Uplands and a  superimposition of Neolithic sites in the southernmost part of the Northern  German Plain. Throughout the Neolithic the margins between soils on loess and the  Weiße Elster floodplain were continuously settled, whereas only Early and Late  Neolithic land use also extended into the Central Uplands. These settlement  patterns are reflected in the results of the Site Exploitation Territories  analyses and explained with environmental economic factors.

	abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The chemical study of materials from natural history and cultural heritage, which provide information for art history, archeology, or paleontology, presents a series of specific challenges. The complexity of these ancient and historical materials, which are chemically heterogeneous, the product of alteration processes, and inherently not reproducible, is a major obstacle to a thorough understanding of their making and long-term behavior (e.g., fossilization). These challenges required the development of methodologies and instruments coupling imaging and data processing approaches that are optimized for the specific properties of the materials. This Account discusses how these characteristics not only constrain their study but also open up specific innovative avenues for providing key historical information. Synchrotron methods have extensively been used since the late 1990s to study heritage objects, in particular for their potential to provide speciation information from excitation spectroscopies and to image complex heritage objects and samples in two and three dimensions at high resolution. We examine in practice how the identification of key intrinsic chemical specificities has offered fertile ground for the development of novel synchrotron approaches allowing a better stochastic description of the properties of ancient and historical materials. These developments encompass three main aspects: (1) The multiscale heterogeneity of these materials can provide an essential source of information in the development of probes targeting their multiple scales of homogeneity. (2) Chemical alteration can be described in many ways, e.g., by segmenting datasets in a semiquantitative way to jointly inform morphological and chemical transformation pathways. (3) The intrinsic individuality of chemical signatures in artifacts triggers the development of specific strategies, such as those focusing on weak signal detection. We propose a rereading of the advent of these new methodologies for analysis and characterization and examine how they have led to innovative strategies combining materials science, instrument development, history, and data science. In particular, we show that spectral imaging and the search for correlations in image datasets have provided a powerful way to address what archeologists have called the uncertainty and ambiguity of the material record. This approach has implications beyond synchrotron techniques and extends in particular to a series of rapidly developing approaches that couple spectral and spatial information, as in hyperspectral imaging and spatially resolved mass spectrometry. The preeminence of correlations holds promise for the future development of machine learning methods for processing data on historical objects. Beyond heritage, these developments are an original source of inspiration for the study of materials in many related fields, such as environmental, geochemical, or life sciences, which deal with systems whose alteration and heterogeneity cannot be neglected.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-021-04721-6},
	abstract = {BackgroundThere are more than 300 species of capillariids that parasitize various vertebrate groups worldwide. Species identification is hindered because of the few taxonomically informative structures available, making the task laborious and genus definition controversial. Thus, its taxonomy is one of the most complex among Nematoda. Eggs are the parasitic structures most viewed in coprological analysis in both modern and ancient samples; consequently, their presence is indicative of positive diagnosis for infection. The structure of the egg could play a role in genera or species discrimination. Institutional biological collections are taxonomic repositories of specimens described and strictly identified by systematics specialists.MethodsThe present work aims to characterize eggs of capillariid species deposited in institutional helminth collections and to process the morphological, morphometric and ecological data using machine learning (ML) as a new approach for taxonomic identification. Specimens of 28 species and 8 genera deposited at ColecAo Helmintologica do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (CHIOC, IOC/FIOCRUZ/Brazil) and Collection de Nematodes Zooparasites du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris (MNHN/France) were examined under light microscopy. In the morphological and morphometric analyses (MM), the total length and width of eggs as well as plugs and shell thickness were considered. In addition, eggshell ornamentations and ecological parameters of the geographical location (GL) and host (H) were included.ResultsThe performance of the logistic model tree (LMT) algorithm showed the highest values in all metrics compared with the other algorithms. Algorithm J48 produced the most reliable decision tree for species identification alongside REPTree. The Majority Voting algorithm showed high metric values, but the combined classifiers did not attenuate the errors revealed in each algorithm alone. The statistical evaluation of the dataset indicated a significant difference between trees, with GL+H+MM and MM only with the best scores.ConclusionsThe present research proposed a novel procedure for taxonomic species identification, integrating data from centenary biological collections and the logic of artificial intelligence techniques. This study will support future research on taxonomic identification and diagnosis of both modern and archaeological capillariids.},

Here, we combine lidar, archaeological excavation data, radiocarbon  dates, and machine learning algorithms to create maps that model the development  of the city and its population growth through time. We conclude that the Greater  Angkor Region was home to approximately 700,000 to 900,000 inhabitants at its  apogee in the 13th century CE. This granular, diachronic, paleodemographic model  of the Angkor complex can be applied to any ancient civilization.},

	abstract = {Computational epigraphy is the study of an ancient script where the computer science and mathematical model is relatively built for epigraphy. The Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions are the most ancient of the extant written of the Tamil. The inscriptions furnish valuable information on many aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country from a period anterior to the literary age of Sangam. The recognition of the script and systematic analysis of the script is required. The recognition of this script is complex, containing various curves for a single character and the style of writing overlap with curves and lines. Generating corpus of the script is necessary, since it is the initial step for computational epigraphy. The archaeological department has supported the raw data that helped to develop a corpus of Tamizhi. In this article, we have implemented a convolution neural network in various ways, i.e., (i) Training the CNN model from scratch a Softmax classifier in a sequential model (ii) using MobileNet: Transfer learning paradigm from a pre-trained model on a Tamizhi dataset (iii) Building Model with CNN and SVM (iv) SVM for evaluation of best accuracy to recognize handwritten Brahmi characters. To train the CNN Model an extensive TAMIZHI handwritten Brahmi Dataset of 1lakh and 90,000 isolated samples for the character has been created and deployed. The designed dataset consists of 9 vowels and 18 consonants and 209 class so researchers can use machine learning. MobileNet outperformed among all the models implemented with the accuracy of 68.3\%, whereas other algorithm ranges from 58\% to 67\% with respect to the Tamizhi dataset. MobileNet model is trained and tested for the dataset of vowels (8 class), consonants (18 class), and consonants vowels (26 class) with the accuracy of 98.1\%, 97.7\%, 97.5\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Pottery is of fundamental importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues created by specialists, held in archives and libraries. The ArchAIDE project worked to streamline, optimise, and economise the mundane aspects of these processes, using the latest automatic image recognition technology, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. The project has developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on site. One method relies on the shape of the fracture outline of a sherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the outline-identification tool, a novel deeplearning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer surfaces. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the classifiers required tackling challenges that arise when working with real-world archaeological data: the paucity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of the different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare types and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some forms. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques. A novel way of training loss allowed us to overcome the problems caused by under-populated classes and non-homogeneous distribution of discriminative features.},

This is achieved by  evaluating sexual dimorphism of commonly used and new skeletal elements via uni-  and multi-variate metric trait analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two  skeletal traits were evaluated in 86 individuals from the William M. Bass donated  cremated collection of known sex and age-at-death. Four different predictive  models, logistic regression, random forest, neural network, and calculation of  population specific cut-off points, were used to determine the classification  accuracy (CA) of each feature and several combinations thereof. RESULTS: An  overall CA of ≥ 80\% was obtained for 12 out of 22 features (humerus trochlea  max., and lunate length, humerus head vertical diameter, humerus head transverse  diameter, radius head max., femur head vertical diameter, patella width, patella  thickness, and talus trochlea length) using univariate analysis. Multivariate  analysis showed an increase of CA (≥ 95\%) for certain combinations and models  (e.g., humerus trochlea max. and patella thickness). Our study shows metric  sexual dimorphism to be well preserved in calcined human remains, despite the  changes that occur during burning. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the  potential of machine learning approaches, such as neural networks, for  multivariate analyses. Using these statistical methods improves the rate of  correct sex estimations in calcined human remains and can be applied to highly  fragmented unburnt individuals from both archaeological and forensic contexts.},

	abstract = {Fine-grained image classification is a challenging research topic because of the high degree of similarity among categories and the high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category caused by different poses and scales. A cultural heritage image is one of the fine-grained images because each image has the same similarity in most cases. Using the classification technique, distinguishing cultural heritage architecture may be difficult. This study proposes a cultural heritage content retrieval method using adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval. The key contribution of this research was the creation of a retrieval model that could handle incremental streams of new categories while maintaining its past performance in old categories and not losing the old categorization of a cultural heritage image. The goal of the proposed method is to perform a retrieval task for classes. Incremental learning for new classes was conducted to reduce the re-training process. In this step, the original class is not necessary for re-training which we call an adaptive deep learning technique. Cultural heritage in the case of Thai archaeological site architecture was retrieved through machine learning and image processing. We analyze the experimental results of incremental learning for fine-grained images with images of Thai archaeological site architecture from world heritage provinces in Thailand, which have a similar architecture. Using a fine-grained image retrieval technique for this group of cultural heritage images in a database can solve the problem of a high degree of similarity among categories and a high degree of dissimilarity for a specific category. The proposed method for retrieving the correct image from a database can deliver an average accuracy of 85 percent. Adaptive deep learning for fine-grained image retrieval was used to retrieve cultural heritage content, and it outperformed state-of-theart methods in fine-grained image retrieval.},

	abstract = {Manual document annotation is an essential technique for knowledge acquisition and capture. Creating high-quality annotations is a difficult task due to inter-annotator discrepancy, the problem that annotators can never agree completely on what and exactly how to annotate. To address this, traditional document annotation involves multiple domain experts working on the same annotation task in an iterative and collaborative manner to identify and resolve discrepancies progressively. However, such a detailed process is often ineffective despite taking significant time and effort; unfortunately, discrepancies remain high in many cases. This paper proposes an alternative approach to document annotation. The approach tackles the problem by firstly studying annotators' suitability based on the types of information to be annotated; then identifying and isolating the most inconsistent annotators who tend to cause the majority of discrepancies in a task; finally distributing annotation workload among the most suitable annotators. Tested in a named entity annotation task in the domain of archaeology, we show that compared to the traditional approach to document annotation, it produces larger amounts of better quality annotations that result in higher machine learning accuracy while requires significantly less time and effort.},

	abstract = {Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human  activities. PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and  for estimating land potential. This paper presents results of assessing machine  learning algorithms-neural networks (nnet package), random forest (ranger),  gradient boosting (gbm), K-nearest neighborhood (class) and Cubist-for  operational mapping of PNV. Three case studies were considered: (1) global  distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8,057 modern  pollen-based site reconstructions), (2) distribution of forest tree taxa in  Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and  (3) global monthly fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation  (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points). A stack of 160 global maps  representing biophysical conditions over land, including atmospheric, climatic,  relief, and lithologic variables, were used as explanatory variables. The overall  results indicate that random forest gives the overall best performance. The  highest accuracy for predicting BIOME 6000 classes (20) was estimated to be  between 33\% (with spatial cross-validation) and 68\% (simple random sub-setting),  with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly  temperatures, and bioclimatic layers. Predicting forest tree species (73)  resulted in mapping accuracy of 25\%, with the most important predictors being  monthly cloud fraction, mean annual and monthly temperatures, and elevation.  Regression models for FAPAR (monthly images) gave an R-square of 90\% with the  most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly cloud  fraction, CHELSA bioclimatic layers, and month of the year, respectively. Further  developments of PNV mapping could include using all GBIF records to map the  global distribution of plant species at different taxonomic levels. This  methodology could also be extended to dynamic modeling of PNV, so that future  climate scenarios can be incorporated. Global maps of biomes, FAPAR and tree  species at one km spatial resolution are available for download via  http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QQHCIK.},

	abstract = {Human carnivory is atypical among primates. Unlike chimpanzees and bonobos, who are known to hunt smaller monkeys and eat them immediately, human foragers often  cooperate to kill large animals and transport them to a safe location to be  shared. While it is known that meat became an important part of the hominin diet  around 2.6-2 Mya, whether intense cooperation and food sharing developed in  conjunction with the regular intake of meat remains unresolved. A widespread  assumption is that early hominins acquired animal protein through  klepto-parasitism at felid kills. This should be testable by detecting  felid-specific bone modifications and tooth marks on carcasses consumed by  hominins. Here, deep learning (DL) computer vision was used to identify agency  through the analysis of tooth pits and scores on bones recovered from the Early  Pleistocene site of DS (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). We present the first objective  evidence of primary access to meat by hominins 1.8 Mya by showing that the most  common securely detectable bone-modifying fissipeds at the site were hyenas. The  absence of felid modifications in most of the carcasses analyzed indicates that  hominins were the primary consumers of most animals accumulated at the site, with  hyenas intervening at the post-depositional stage. This underscores the role of  hominins as a prominent part of the early Pleistocene African carnivore guild. It  also stresses the major (and potentially regular) role that meat played in the  diet that configured the emergence of early Homo.},

We chose an object group which is defined by its complexity in shape and the similarity between the objects: In 4th and 3rd century BC ancient Greece small terracotta figurines used to be an art form that was quite common. Based on 200 of those terracottas, a classification system will be elaborated with digital methods, which is able to meet the complexity of the artefacts. In close cooperation between computer science and archaeology, this experimental process leads to a fundamental examination of the concept of pattern recognition as a humanities category.

Aim. The aim of the model is to study the military tactics of the Celtic population. The simulations are focused on different defense tactics of the Celtic oppidum. The succession rate of attack and the number of casualties is studied with various scenarios with varying ratios of the defenders and attackers, areas of attack, and combination of weapons.
Methods. The environment of this agent-based model of Celtic oppidum siege is based on archaeological findings from the long gone oppidum, Stare Hradisko, located in the Czech Republic. The agents operating in this model represent either residents of the oppidum who are defending their homes, or the attackers.
Results. The tool created enables studying different scenarios of attack on a Celtic oppidum. Simulations can be used for testing attacks on different locations if the GIS data of the terrain and fortification are provided.},

Considering farming as the main activity for sustaining the early Minoan civilization, we evaluate the impact of different social organization models and agricultural strategies on population viability and spatial distribution of settlement locations over a 2000 year period. Interestingly, one of the social models examined promotes the targeted redistribution of wealth, and is inspired by a recent framework for self-organizing agent organizations. Model parameters are based on archaeological studies, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability for settlements adopting a socio-economic organization model based on self-organization; while the emerging "stratified" populations are larger than their egalitarian counterparts. This provides support for theories proposing the existence of different social strata in early Bronze Age Crete, considering them a pre-requisite for the emergence of the complex social structure evident in later periods. Moreover, observed population dispersion agrees with existing archaeological evidence.},

Unlike conventional "crowd" models, our comprehensive, detailed models of individual autonomous pedestrians span several modeling levels, including appearance, locomotion, perception, behavior, and cognition. We review our human simulation system and its application to a "modern archaeological" recreation of activity in New York City's original Pennsylvania Station.

	abstract = {The present paper addresses an approach for merging heritage survey and archaeological knowledge. The theoretical framework is the integration between photogrammetric survey and documentation process, practically used in different archaeological excavation. Information is sorted by source. A source is a set of information provided by the operators involved in the excavation process. The merging process involves the verification of the consistency of different sources and the aggregation of all the information from the sources into a global result. Each source, respectively each operator, owns a personal representation of his knowledge domain. Merging together all these sets of information needs a method which can be easily operated by most of the participants in the research and which can furthermore manage the 'multiple knowledge' on the surveyed object. The merge process is theoretically defined in a reversible framework for propositional bases merging. This framework is presented in a semantic way and applied by the development of merging tool. This tool uses a simple interface for displaying results and knowledge in various form (textual, 2D map, 3D scene, XML). The tool provides a simple easy to use interface. Finally, a real case study will be. The selected case study is the Castle of Shawbak, in Jordan, known in medieval written sources as the "Crac de Montreal".},

In order to map these historic monuments for the purpose of settlement-study and conser-vation, we develop a machine learning classifier which identifies probable tell sites from the terrain model. In a test, point-like elevations of a characteristic tell shape, standing out for more than 5 to 6 m in the DEM were successfully detected (85/133 tells). False positives (327/(600*1200) pixels) were primarily due to natural elevations, resembling tells in height and size.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12961-016-0155-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid reviews have the potential to overcome a key barrier to the use of research evidence in decision making, namely that of the lack of timely and relevant research. This rapid review of systematic reviews and primary studies sought to answer the question: What are the best methodologies to enable a rapid review of research evidence for evidence-informed decision making in health policy and practice?
METHODS: This rapid review utilised systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol including clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO registration: CRD42015015998). A comprehensive search strategy was used, including published and grey literature, written in English, French, Portuguese or Spanish, from 2004 onwards. Eleven databases and two websites were searched. Two review authors independently applied the eligibility criteria. Data extraction was done by one reviewer and checked by a second. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers. A narrative summary of the results is presented.
RESULTS: Five systematic reviews and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that investigated methodologies for rapid reviews met the inclusion criteria. None of the systematic reviews were of sufficient quality to allow firm conclusions to be made. Thus, the findings need to be treated with caution. There is no agreed definition of rapid reviews in the literature and no agreed methodology for conducting rapid reviews. While a wide range of 'shortcuts' are used to make rapid reviews faster than a full systematic review, the included studies found little empirical evidence of their impact on the conclusions of either rapid or systematic reviews. There is some evidence from the included RCT (that had a low risk of bias) that rapid reviews may improve clarity and accessibility of research evidence for decision makers.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater care needs to be taken in improving the transparency of the methods used in rapid review products. There is no evidence available to suggest that rapid reviews should not be done or that they are misleading in any way. We offer an improved definition of rapid reviews to guide future research as well as clearer guidance for policy and practice.},

	abstract = {Historical land cover (LC) maps are an essential instrument for studying long-term spatio-temporal changes of the landscape. However, manual labelling on low-quality monochromatic historical orthophotos for semantic segmentation (pixel-level classification) is particularly challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for the automated extraction of very-high-resolution (VHR) multi-class LC maps from historical orthophotos under the absence of target-specific ground truth annotations. The methodology builds on recent evolutions in deep learning, leveraging domain adaptation and transfer learning. First, an unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation between a source domain (recent RGB image of high quality, annotations available) and the target domain (historical monochromatic image of low quality, no annotations available) is learned using a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Second, a state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is pre-trained on a large annotated RGB earth observation (EO) dataset that is converted to the target domain using the I2I function. Third, the FCN is fine-tuned using self-annotated data on a recent RGB orthophoto of the study area under consideration, after conversion using again the I2I function. The methodology is tested on a new custom dataset: the 'Sagalassos historical land cover dataset', which consists of three historical monochromatic orthophotos (1971, 1981, 1992) and one recent RGB orthophoto (2015) of VHR (0.3-0.84 m GSD) all capturing the same greater area around Sagalassos archaeological site (Turkey), and corresponding manually created annotations (2.7 km(2) per orthophoto) distinguishing 14 different LC classes. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of open-source annotated EO datasets for multiclass semantic segmentation is provided, based on which an appropriate pretraining dataset can be selected. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is effective, increasing the mean intersection over union by 27.2\% when using domain adaptation, and by 13.0\% when using domain pretraining, and that transferring weights from a model pretrained on a dataset closer to the target domain is preferred.},

In this respect, machine learning (ML) works similar to typology. ML approaches are often deployed because it is thought that they reduce biases. However, biases are introduced into the process at many points, e.g., feature selection. In a project applying ML to Scandinavian rock art data, it was noticed that the algorithm struggles with classifying certain motifs correctly. This contribution discusses the consistency in applying biases by ML in contrast to the inconsistency of human classification. It is argued that it is necessary to bring machines and humans into a meaningful dialogue attempting to understand why apparent "misclassifications " happen. This is important to inform us about the classification output, our biases, and the rock art data, which are in themself inconsistent, ambiguous, and biased because they are the outcomes of human creativity. The human inconsistency is a necessary component because in rock art not everything that looks similar has a similar meaning.},

	abstract = {Very high-resolution (VHR) image data, including from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms, are increasingly acquired for wildlife surveys. Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, however, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in VHR aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is complicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests (similar to 1-2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses (OBIA) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neighborhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90\% of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled {\textless}2\% of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visually screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heterogeneous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some UAV-based imagery and the growing body of VHR imagery available in Google Earth and other virtual globes.},

	abstract = {The Dead Sea Scrolls are of immense historical significance. Unfortunately, the scrolls have deteriorated over the millennia and continue to deteriorate since their discovery. Thus, it is of paramount importance to preserve for posterity the current state of the material as best as possible. This goal is being pursued in various ways. One is via the ongoing digitization efforts of the Israel Antiquities Authority, which complement the older infrared images of plates of fragments done under the auspices of the Palestine Archaeological Museum. Each of the thousands of parchment and papyrus fragments is carefully placed on a black felt background and then photographed at high resolution. Resultant color and infrared images are being made available to all in the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library.
At the same time, we are in the midst of an international project with the goal of designing and building algorithmic tools that will relate the different images of scroll fragments with each other and with their textual transcriptions. As part of this effort, we are in the process of incorporating a deep-learning based segmentation method into the pipeline, which will allow one to manipulate images of the individual fragments themselves. Previous segmentation efforts succeeded in removing most of the shadows from the older images but failed to remove from the foreground of the new images those parts that show the Japanese tissue paper used by conservators to strengthen the edges of the fragment and hold it in place.
We solve the problem of identifying and removing the tissue from the segmented images. This advance dramatically improves the effectiveness of our matching algorithms for searching among the old plates for the location of the newly-digitized fragments. In particular, the improved matching has allowed us to locate two fragments whose positions on the old plates were not recorded. The matching algorithm is being incorporated in the new platform and will begin serving scroll scholars in the near future.},

	abstract = {Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology can be used to identify features of terrain relief in forested areas, possibly leading to the discovery of previously unknown archaeological monuments. Spatial interpretation of numerous objects with various shapes and sizes is a difficult challenge for archaeologists. Mapping structures with multiple elements whose area can exceed dozens of hectares, such as ancient agricultural field systems, is very time-consuming. These archaeological sites are composed of a large number of embanked fields, which together form a recognizable spatial pattern. Image classification and segmentation, as well as object recognition, are the most important tasks for deep learning neural networks (DLNN) and therefore they can be used for automatic recognition of archaeological monuments. In this study, a U-Net neural network was implemented to perform semantic segmentation of the ALS-derived data including (1) archaeological, (2) natural and (3) modern features in the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest. The performance of the U-Net segmentation model was evaluated by measuring the pixel-wise similarity between ground truth and predicted segmentation masks. After 83 epochs, The Dice-Sorensen coefficient (F1 score) and the Intersect Over Union (IoU) metrics were 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. The IoU metric reached a value of 0.41, 0.62 and 0.62 for the ancient field system banks, ancient field system plots and burial mounds, respectively. The results of the U-Net deep learning model proved very useful in semantic segmentation of images derived from ALS data.},

Here, the initial steps in the development of a virtual database for archaeological parenchyma are detailed. Foremost, a protocol for the microCT scanning and virtual reconstruction of modern reference material and also of archaeological parenchyma is detailed. The protocol enables a 3D virtual representation of scanned materials to be recon-structed at high resolution (the highest resolution typically being between 2 and 3 mu m), which can be interro-gated qualitatively (user-defined) and quantitatively (using automated segmentation, algorithms and eventually deep learning neural networks) to enable taxonomic differentiation and comparability. The protocol is presented to enable replicability of analysis and also to ensure standardization in the future development of an online, open access and editable, 3D virtual database of modern reference samples and archaeological parenchyma.},

This identification, based on phytolith wave pattern, is made using a pretrained VGG19 deep learning model. This approach has been tested in three key phytolith genera for the study of agricultural origins in Near East archaeology: Avena, Hordeum and Triticum. Also, this classification has been validated at species-level using Triticum boeoticum and dicoccoides images. Due to the diversity of microscopes, cameras and chemical treatments that can influence images of phytolith slides, three types of data augmentation techniques have been implemented: rotation of the images at 45-degree angles, random colour and brightness jittering, and random blur/sharpen. The implemented workflow has resulted in an overall accuracy of 93.68\% for phytolith genera, improving previous attempts. The algorithm has also demonstrated its potential to automatize the classification of phytoliths species with an overall accuracy of 100\%. The open code and platforms employed to develop the algorithm assure the method's accessibility, reproducibility and reusability.},

	abstract = {Due to complicated backgrounds and unclear target orientation, automated object detection is difficult in the field of archaeology. Most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) object-oriented detection techniques are based on a faster region-based CNN (R-CNN) and other one-stage detectors that often lack adequate processing speeds and detection accuracies. Recently, the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN technique achieved impressive results in object detection and instance segmentation problems and was successfully applied in the analysis of archaeological airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In this study, we outline a modified Mask R-CNN technique that reliably and efficiently detects relict charcoal hearth (RCH) sites on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data-based digital elevation models (DEMs). Using image augmentation and image preprocessing steps combined with the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique, we could improve the model's accuracy and significantly reduce its training time. We use DEMs based on high-resolution LiDAR data and the visualization for archaeological topography (VAT) technique that give images with a very strong contrast of the terrain and the outline of the sites of interest in the North German Lowland. Therefore, the model can identify RCH sites with an average recall of 83\% and an average precision of 87\%. Techniques such as the modified Mask R-CNN method outlined here will help to greatly improve our knowledge about archaeological site densities in the realm of historical charcoal production and past human-landscape interactions. This method provides an accurate, time-efficient and bias-free large-scale site mapping option not only for the North German Lowland but potentially for other landscapes as well.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jas.2021.105456},
	abstract = {This paper presents a case study on Early Medieval burial practices using AGNES, an intelligent search engine for Dutch archaeological grey literature. Traditionally, it is assumed that cremations phased out at the start of the Early Middle Ages, when the inhumation practice became more numerous. However, recent research (Lippok, 2020) shows that cremations might be more prevalent than previously assumed. Due to research efforts being concentrated on furnished inhumations, cremations and other types of burials have not received their share of research interest. It is suspected that unknown Early Medieval cremations may be found in grey literature research reports. The rapidly growing document collection requires more efficient methods to search through this big data, as manual searching is too time intensive. AGNES uses machine learning to allow searching on archaeological concepts (such as time periods and artefacts) in full texts, solving common problems with synonymy and polysemy. This paper describes a controlled search for Early Medieval cremations in the Netherlands, and a comparison of the new information uncovered from the reports to prior knowledge on the topic. The queries resulted in 2541 hits. Twenty-three Early Medieval cremations that were previously unknown to experts were uncovered, and 31 (of 77) known sites were identified. Forty-one possibly interesting documents were noted, where it was not clear from the report if Early Medieval cremations were present. 2446 documents were not relevant to the study for various reasons. The 23 new sites are an increase of 30\% over the existing knowledge of experts. In the last 20 years only nine new sites featuring Early Medieval cremations were discovered, so being able to add another 23 is a major development. Adding previously unknown Early Medieval cremations to the dataset challenges the existing bias for inhumation graves, and supports striving towards viewing the Early Medieval burial repertoire as more heterogeneous and representative. This indicates that AGNES is useful for archaeological research, and the uncovered information can lead to a more cohesive view of the past.},

One main goal of paleographers is to identify the different scribes (writers) who wrote a given manuscript. Deep learning has recently received much attention from researchers as classification system and has been applied to many domains. However, this approach is based on the hypothesis that large amount of labeled data are available. To overcome this drawback, transfer learning techniques have been proposed. These techniques use parts of large deep networks, learned by using very large image datasets, as starting points for the learning of networks to solve a more specific classification problem. In this paper, we present a deep transfer learning based tool to help paleographers in identifying the parts of a manuscript that were written by the same writer. The proposed approach has been tested on a set of digital images from a Bible of the XII century. The achieved results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {The identification of cut marks and other bone surface modifications (BSM) provides evidence for the emergence of meat-eating in human evolution. This most crucial part of taphonomic analysis of the archaeological human record has been controversial due to highly subjective interpretations of BSM. Here, we use a sample of 79 trampling and cut marks to compare the accuracy in mark identification on bones by human experts and computer trained algorithms. We demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) can recognize marks with accuracy that far exceeds that of human experts. Automated recognition and analysis of BSM using DCNN can achieve an accuracy of 91\% of correct identification of cut and trampling marks versus a much lower accuracy rate (63\%) obtained by trained human experts. This success underscores the capability of machine learning algorithms to help resolve controversies in taphonomic research and, more specifically, in the study of bone surface modifications. We envision that the proposed methods can help resolve on-going controversies on the earliest human meat-eating behaviors in Africa and other issues such as the earliest occupation of America.

Among their programs, OTF creates hands on learning opportunities for students and people interested in marine science, technology and education. This paper will describe opportunities and experiences of an undergraduate student, Jenna Carlson, from the University of Connecticut (UConn), who works closely with OTF in education and outreach coordination. These hands on learning opportunities and internships provide vital experiences to students like Jenna that will influence their career decisions in the future.
For example, OTF and UConn in cooperation with Zoomarine, a marine park and education facility in the Algarve of Portugal, have established a study abroad internship program. Students are able to participate as interns and work closely with marine mammal trainers in all aspects of their daily jobs. As an intern, Jenna participated in training, medical procedures, feeding and daily maintenance of seven Bottlenose dolphins at Zoomarine. As another example, OTF sponsors a Science, Education and Marine Archeology Program in Portugal (SEMAPP). In April 2004 a SEMAPP expedition was conducted using the Delta submersible. Jenna assisted OTT with much of the planning and preparation for the expedition and played a critical role in carrying out education and outreach aspects of the program. This included working with Portuguese high school students on the research vessel, planning a daily schedule for the students, and creating hands-on learning activities.
The experiences here created an exciting opportunity for Jenna, as she is the first U.S. undergraduate student to make a deep-sea dive in Portugal. In addition to her role with education and outreach coordination, Jenna was exposed to the disciplines of marine archeology, marine technology, fisheries ecology and marine geology, as well as presenting at national conferences and the opportunity to network with educators and scientists working in these disciplines. On a personal level, the opportunity provided guidance in Jenna's decisions about a professional career.},

Critical  interpretations of when humans started eating meat and animal fat or when they  started using stone tools, or when they occupied new continents or interacted  with predatory guilds impinge on accurate identifications of BSM. Until now,  interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene BSM have been contentious because of the high  uncertainty in discriminating among taphonomic agents. Recently, the use of  machine learning algorithms has yielded high accuracy in the identification of  BSM. A branch of machine learning methods based on imaging, computer vision (CV),  has opened the door to a more objective and accurate method of BSM  identification. The present work has selected two extremely similar types of BSM  (cut marks made on fleshed an defleshed bones) to test the immense potential of  artificial intelligence methods. This CV approach not only produced the highest  accuracy in the classification of these types of BSM until present (95\% on  complete images of BSM and 88.89\% of images of only internal mark features), but  it also has enabled a method for determining which inconspicuous microscopic  features determine successful BSM discrimination. The potential of this method in  other areas of taphonomy and paleobiology is enormous.},

	abstract = {"Re-learn" and "Re-value" are the keywords at the base of the sustainable exploitation strategy of cultural heritage, little known but highly cultural and environmental valid, belonging to Southern Italy, already colony of Magna Graecia. The main goals are to "spread" the knowledge of the territory, "enhance" the sense of belonging to a new physical and cultural reality, "develop" the perception of a new metropolitan reality and "promote" the enjoyment of the environment, aiming at a careful and conscious cultural tourism. Within the tourism network, our idea tends to include particularly significant and representative sites of Campania's history and culture, little known ones such as Campi Flegrei, Sorrento and Amalfi Coasts, Liternum, Nola, Cimitile, Amalfi, Agerola, Gragnano, etc. The present case study concerns, in particular, the Valle dei Mulini ("Mills valley") in Gragnano, which is an example of proto-industrial archaeology dating back to the twelfth century as well as an old dirt road connecting with Amalfi republic. This site is featured by canals carved into the rocks, which lead water directly to the mills towers, capable of converting the pressure of the hydraulic machine movement into useful energy. More in detail, the sustainable aspect of this project foresees the production of electricity by exploiting the mechanism of the falling water in water towers, giving rise to the grindstone rotational motion which is turned into electrical energy. The water flow passes from one tower to another one, placed at a lower altitude, and then moves on to the next one. Therefore this strategy would enhance the whole ecosystem, by means of site remediation and artifacts restoration, in order to place this resort in the tourism / hospitality circuit and trigger a sustainable process aimed at its future safeguarding.

Towards more automation, we present a new method that adopts a deep learning approach for the detection and the recognition of objects of interest, amphorae for example. In order to provide more readable, direct and clearer illustrations, we describe several techniques that generate different styles of sketches out of orthophotos developed using neural networks. In the same direction, we present the Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) technique, which converts a 3D model into a more readable 2D representation that is more useful to communicate and simplifies the identification of objects of interest. Regarding public dissemination, we demonstrate how recent advances in virtual reality to provide an accurate, high resolution, amusing and appropriate visualization tool that offers the public the possibility to 'visit' an unreachable archaeological site. Finally, we conclude by introducing the plenoptic approach, a new promising technology that can change the future of the photogrammetry by making it easier and less time consuming and that allows a user to create a 3D model using only one camera shot. Here, we introduce the concepts, the developing process, and some results, which we obtained with underwater imaging.},

	abstract = {A mosaic, made of small coloured tiles, called tesserae or tessellas, is a form of decorative art to create images and patterns on a surface. One of the first steps to obtain digital mosaics is the segmentation process to separate (identify) tesserae. Then, various tools are necessary to catalog the digitalized scenes, to extract the figures, such as animal or human beings, from the puzzle of small pieces, to geolocalize the segmented objects and to assign a semantic meaning to them. While some mosaic segmentation approaches have already been reported in the literature, currently, mosaic segmentation is still done by human operators, resulting time consuming and error prone. We propose in this paper an automatic approach, based on Deep Learning, to segment the mosaic floor tesserae of the church of S. Stephen in Umm ar Rasas. Our approach allows to obtain automatically and with good reliability the description of the main elements of a mosaic (the tesserae) that are not homogeneous. The experiments performed on the collected tesserae dataset yield high accuracies and demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of our approach.},

	abstract = {Mosaic is an ancient type of art used to create decorative images or patterns combining small components. A digital version of a mosaic can be useful for archaeologists, scholars and restorers who are interested in studying, comparing and preserving mosaics. Nowadays, archaeologists base their studies mainly on manual operation and visual observation that, although still fundamental, should be supported by an automatized procedure of information extraction. In this context, this research explains improvements which can change the manual and time-consuming procedure of mosaic tesserae drawing. More specifically, this paper analyses the advantages of using Mo.Se. (Mosaic Segmentation), an algorithm that exploits deep learning and image segmentation techniques; the methodology combines U-Net 3 Network with the Watershed algorithm. The final purpose is to define a workflow which establishes the steps to perform a robust segmentation and obtain a digital (vector) representation of a mosaic. The detailed approach is presented, and theoretical justifications are provided, building various connections with other models, thus making the workflow both theoretically valuable and practically scalable for medium or large datasets. The automatic segmentation process was tested with the high-resolution orthoimage of an ancient mosaic by following a close-range photogrammetry procedure. Our approach has been tested in the pavement of St. Stephen's Church in Umm ar-Rasas, a Jordan archaeological site, located 30 km southeast of the city of Madaba (Jordan). Experimental results show that this generalized framework yields good performances, obtaining higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Mo.Se. has been validated using publicly available datasets as a benchmark, demonstrating that the combination of learning-based methods with procedural ones enhances segmentation performance in terms of overall accuracy, which is almost 10\% higher. This study's ambitious aim is to provide archaeologists with a tool which accelerates their work of automatically extracting ancient geometric mosaics.},

The recent emergence of national scale remotely sensed datasets has created the potential to greatly increase the rate of analysis and recording of cultural heritage sites. However, the time and resources required to process these datasets in traditional desktop surveys presents a near insurmountable challenge. The use of artificial intelligence to carry out preliminary processing of vast areas could enable experts to prioritize their prospection focus; however, success so far has been hindered by the lack of large training datasets in this field. This study develops an innovative transfer learning approach, utilizing a deep convolutional neural network initially trained on Lunar LiDAR datasets and reapplied here in an archaeological context. Recall rates of 80\% and 83\% were obtained on the 0.5 m and 0.25 m resolution datasets respectively, with false positive rates maintained below 20\%. These results are state of the art and demonstrate that this model is an efficient, effective tool for semi-automated object detection for this type of archaeological objects. Further tests indicated strong potential for detection of other types of archaeological objects when trained accordingly.},

The operation of ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) nevertheless requires significant off-shore dedicated manpower to handle and operate the robotic platform and the supporting vessel. In order to reduce the footprint of operations, DexROV proposes to implement and evaluate novel operation paradigms with safer, more cost effective and time efficient ROV operations. As a keystone of the proposed approach, manned support will in a large extent be delocalized within an onshore ROV control center, possibly at a large distance from the actual operations, relying on satellite communications. The proposed scheme also makes provision for advanced dexterous manipulation and semi-autonomous capabilities, leveraging human expertise when deemed useful.

	abstract = {Historical maps present a unique depiction of past landscapes, providing evidence for a wide range of information such as settlement distribution, past land use, natural resources, transport networks, toponymy and other natural and cultural data within an explicitly spatial context. Maps produced before the expansion of large-scale mechanized agriculture reflect a landscape that is lost today. Of particular interest to us is the great quantity of archaeologically relevant information that these maps recorded, both deliberately and incidentally. Despite the importance of the information they contain, researchers have only recently begun to automatically digitize and extract data from such maps as coherent information, rather than manually examine a raster image. However, these new approaches have focused on specific types of information that cannot be used directly for archaeological or heritage purposes. This paper provides a proof of concept of the application of deep learning techniques to extract archaeological information from historical maps in an automated manner. Early twentieth century colonial map series have been chosen, as they provide enough time depth to avoid many recent large-scale landscape modifications and cover very large areas (comprising several countries). The use of common symbology and conventions enhance the applicability of the method. The results show deep learning to be an efficient tool for the recovery of georeferenced, archaeologically relevant information that is represented as conventional signs, line-drawings and text in historical maps. The method can provide excellent results when an adequate training dataset has been gathered and is therefore at its best when applied to the large map series that can supply such information. The deep learning approaches described here open up the possibility to map sites and features across entire map series much more quickly and coherently than other available methods, opening up the potential to reconstruct archaeological landscapes at continental scales.},

The ArchAIDE project realised an AI-based application to recognise archaeological pottery. Pottery is of paramount importance for understanding archaeological contexts. However, recognition of ceramics is still a manual, time-consuming activity, reliant on analogue catalogues. The project developed two complementary machine-learning tools to propose identifications based on images captured on-site, for optimising and economising this process, while retaining key decision points necessary to create trusted results. One method relies on the shape of a potsherd; the other is based on decorative features. For the shape-based recognition, a novel deep-learning architecture was employed, integrating shape information from points along the inner and outer profile of a sherd. The decoration classifier is based on relatively standard architectures used in image recognition. In both cases, training the algorithms meant facing challenges related to real-world archaeological data: the scarcity of labelled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to take note of minute differentiating features. Finally, the creation of a desktop and mobile application that integrates the AI classifiers provides an easy-to-use interface for pottery classification and storing pottery data.},

	abstract = {Comparison of echelle spectra to synthetic models has become a computational statistics challenge, with over 10,000 individual spectral lines affecting a typical cool star echelle spectrum. Telluric artifacts, imperfect line lists, inexact continuum placement, and inflexible models frustrate the scientific promise of these information-rich data sets. Here we debut an interpretable machine-learning framework blase that addresses these and other challenges. The semiempirical approach can be viewed as "transfer learning"-first pretraining models on noise-free precomputed synthetic spectral models, then learning the corrections to line depths and widths from whole-spectrum fitting to an observed spectrum. The auto-differentiable model employs back-propagation, the fundamental algorithm empowering modern deep learning and neural networks. Here, however, the 40,000+ parameters symbolize physically interpretable line profile properties such as amplitude, width, location, and shape, plus radial velocity and rotational broadening. This hybrid data-/model-driven framework allows joint modeling of stellar and telluric lines simultaneously, a potentially transformative step forward for mitigating the deleterious telluric contamination in the near-infrared. The blase approach acts as both a deconvolution tool and semiempirical model. The general-purpose scaffolding may be extensible to many scientific applications, including precision radial velocities, Doppler imaging, chemical abundances for Galactic archeology, line veiling, magnetic fields, and remote sensing. Its sparse-matrix architecture and GPU acceleration make blase fast. The open-source PyTorch-based code blase includes tutorials, Application Programming Interface documentation, and more. We show how the tool fits into the existing Python spectroscopy ecosystem, demonstrate a range of astrophysical applications, and discuss limitations and future extensions.},

	abstract = {The use of bioavailable strontium in different environments to provenance biological materials has become increasingly common since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.},

The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence. The reflections and the success represented by the trained models open novel avenues for future research on rock art.},

Brick segmentation is an important initial step in the documentation and analysis of masonry wall images. However, due to the heterogeneous material, size, shape and arrangement of the bricks, it is highly challenging to develop a widely adoptable solution for the problem via conventional geometric and radiometry based approaches. In this paper, we propose a new technique which combines the strength of deep learning for brick seed localization, and the Watershed algorithm for accurate instance segmentation. More specifically, we adopt a U-Net-based delineation algorithm for robust marker generation in the Watershed process, which provides as output the accurate contours of the individual bricks, and also separates them from the mortar regions. For training the network and evaluating our results, we created a new test dataset which consist of 162 hand-labeled images of various wall categories. Quantitative evaluation is provided both at instance and at pixel level, and the results are compared to two reference methods proposed for wall delineation, and to a morphology based brick segmentation approach. The experimental results showed the advantages of the proposed U-Net markered Watershed method, providing average F1-scores above 80\%.},

At the beginning, a U-Net-based sub-network performs initial wall segmentation into brick, mortar and occluded regions, which is followed by a two-stage adversarial inpainting model. The first adversarial network predicts the schematic mortar-brick pattern of the occluded areas based on the observed wall structure, providing in itself valuable structural information for archeological and architectural applications. The second adversarial network predicts the pixels' color values yielding a realistic visual experience for the observer. Finally, using the neural network outputs as markers in a watershed-based segmentation process, we generate the accurate contours of the individual bricks, both in the originally visible and in the artificially inpainted wall regions. Note that while the first three stages implement a sequential pipeline, they interact through dependencies of their loss functions admitting the consideration of hidden feature dependencies between the different network components. For training and testing the network a new dataset has been created, and an extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation versus the state-of-the-art is given. The experiments confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the reference techniques both in terms of wall structure estimation and regarding the visual quality of the inpainting step, moreover it can be robustly used for various different masonry wall types.},

The method sets up a new target for deep-learning, integrating information from points along inner and outer surfaces to learn about shapes. Training the classifiers required tackling multiple challenges that arose on account of our working with real-world archeological data: paucity of labeled data; extreme imbalance between instances of different categories; and the need to avoid neglecting rare classes and to take note of minute distinguishing features of some classes. The scarcity of training data was overcome by using synthetically-produced virtual potsherds and by employing multiple data-augmentation techniques. A novel form of training loss allowed us to overcome classification problems caused by under-populated classes and inhomogeneous distribution of discriminative features.},

By example of excavations in Alken Enge, Denmark, this paper explores how a web-based 3D platform is able to facilitate the collaborative exchange of 3D excavation content and how the integration of spatial and attribute data into one common event-based data model may be advantageous. This includes enhancing the semantic value of field-recorded 3D models by segmenting the geometry using various techniques, such as 3D projections and machine learning. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a framework for interactive 3D models, which includes attributed classification based on segmented 3D content correlated with traditional raster, vector, and textual data, delivering a spatially integrated platform for collaborative research.},

In this sense, the current paper is an anomaly in that the "artefact" motivating this historical review of the hydrological cycle was observed first in the classroom. More specifically, many years of teaching hydrology has highlighted the difficulty students often have in achieving a broad and deep understanding of hydrological processes. Several reasons could be proposed for the observed pedagogical difficulties, but what is of interest here is that a student's struggles are reminiscent of the historical ones relating to first deducing the hydrological cycle. Thus, a novel hypothesis is tentatively advanced: concepts that were tortuous or taxing to deduce historically often, and for quite similar reasons, are challenging to teach, and vice versa. While a comprehensive psychological exploration of this observation is beyond the scope of this article, a few broader connections are briefly explored.},

The results of such a process are used in archaeology for analyzing the origin and manufacturing techniques of ancient ceramics. In this paper we present a methodology for the segmentation and analysis of thin sections of material segments and reaching some conclusions in a fully automatic way. We employ machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze a video of the thin section sample, acquired under an optical microscope. When examined under polarized light, the color of segments may vary during sample rotation. This variation is due to the optical properties of the materials and it provides valuable information about the material inclusions in the sample. Using the video as our input, we perform an entire-video segmentation. To accomplish this task, we developed a hierarchical categorical mean-shift-based algorithm. Using the entire-video segmentation we examine the detected segments and gather statistical information about their sizes, shapes and colors and present an overall report about the sample. We tested the algorithm on nine specimens of ancient ceramics, taken from three different Mediterranean sites. The results show clear differences between the sites in the amounts, sizes and shapes of the segments present in the specimens.},

Fortunately, low-resolution grayscale infrared images of the Palestinian Archaeological Museum plates holding the scrolls in their discovered state are extant, along with recent high-quality multispectral images by the Israel Antiquities Authority. However, the necessary task of identifying each fragment in the new images on the old plates is tedious and time consuming to perform manually, and is often problematic when fragments have been moved from the original plate.
We describe an automated system that segments the new and old images of fragments from the background on which they were imaged, finds their matches on the old plates and aligns and superimposes them. To this end, we developed a deep-learning based segmentation method and a cascade approach for template matching, based on scale, shape analysis and dense matching.
We have tested the proposed method on five plates, comprising about 120 fragments. We present both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the results and perform an ablation study to evaluate the importance of each component of our system.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists are interested in better understanding matters of our human past based on material culture. The tools we use to approach archaeological research questions range from the trowel and brush to, more recently, even those of artificial intelligence. As access to computing technology has increased over time, the breadth of computer-assisted methods in archaeology has also increased. This proliferation has provided us a considerable toolset towards engaging both new and longstanding questions, especially as interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeologists, computer scientists, and engineers continues to grow. As an example of an archaeological project engaging in computer-based approaches, the Guadalupe/Colon Archaeological Project is presented as a case study. Project applications and methodologies range from the regional-scale identification of sites using a geographic information system (GIS) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) down to the microscopic scale of classifying ceramic materials with convolutional neural networks. Methods relating to the 3D modeling of sites, features, and artifacts and the benefits therein are also explored. In this paper, an overview of the methods used by the project is covered, which includes 1) predictive modeling using a GIS slope analysis for the identification of possible site locations, 2) structure from motion (SfM) drone imagery for site mapping and characterization, 3) airborne LiDAR for site identification, mapping, and characterization, 4) 3D modeling of stone features for improved visualization, 5) 3D modeling of ceramic artifacts for more efficient documentation, and 6) the application of deep learning for automated classification of ceramic materials in thin section. These approaches are discussed and critically considered with the understanding that interdisciplinary cooperation between domain experts in engineering, computer science, and archaeology is an important means of improving and expanding upon digital methodologies in archaeology as a whole.},

	abstract = {The growing availability of three-dimensional (3D) data, such as point clouds, coming from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Mobile Mapping Systems (MMSs) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), provides the opportunity to rapidly generate 3D models to support the restoration, conservation, and safeguarding activities of cultural heritage (CH). The so-called scan-to-BIM process can, in fact, benefit from such data, and they can themselves be a source for further analyses or activities on the archaeological and built heritage. There are several ways to exploit this type of data, such as Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM), mesh creation, rasterisation, classification, and semantic segmentation. The latter, referring to point clouds, is a trending topic not only in the CH domain but also in other fields like autonomous navigation, medicine or retail. Precisely in these sectors, the task of semantic segmentation has been mainly exploited and developed with artificial intelligence techniques. In particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and their deep learning (DL) subset, are increasingly applied and have established a solid state-of-the-art in the last half-decade. However, applications of DL techniques on heritage point clouds are still scarce; therefore, we propose to tackle this framework within the built heritage field. Starting from some previous tests with the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN), in this research close attention is paid to: i) the investigation of fine-tuned models, used as a transfer learning technique, ii) the combination of external classifiers, such as Random Forest (RF), with the artificial neural network, and iii) data augmentation results evaluation for the domain-specific ArCH dataset. Finally, after analysing the main advantages and critical aspects, a proposal is made evaluating the extent to which this methodology can also be useful for non-programming or domain experts.},

Understanding the inscriptions is important in terms of researching world history, character evaluations, and more. This work introduces a state-of-art initiative to recognize oracle bone inscriptions by deep learning. This is the first time an oracle bone inscription dataset featuring real rubbing images has been generated. For training before recognition, we augment the inscription images by means of rotation, Gaussian noise addition, cutting, brightness changing and inversion, which turns one image into 3,072 new images. We change the dropout, layer number, and filter number of every layer, so as to improve recognition ability and achieve a prefect recognition rate. By analyzing the mistaken recognitions, we identify some special characters that should be given special data augmentation. In an experiment using 184 difference characters and a dataset consisting of 2,000 images including 538 test images, parameter tuning and data augmentation resulted in the recognition rate of 92.3\%, and the training data was augmented into 9.69 million items.},

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented. We believe this survey will be helpful to aggregate the research efforts and eliminate the technical uncertainties towards breakthrough novelties of IoUT.},

Comparing various strategies revealed learning through social networks while evolving the extent of the network as the best adaptive strategy. The results are consistent with archeological records as a wider margin is observed between social and non-social learners during periods known for the highest landscape variability.

The study focuses on a specific kind of ancient painted pottery from the American Southwest, Tusayan White Ware, but we believe it has broader implications for a wide range of geographical settings and artifact types. Our results show that when properly trained, a deep learning model can assign types to digital images of decorated sherds with an accuracy comparable to, and sometimes higher than, four expert-level contemporary archaeologists. The technique also offers novel tools for visualizing both the importance of diagnostic design elements and overall design relationships between groups of pottery sherds. We demonstrate that this method can objectively match a specific unclassified sherd image to its most similar counterparts through a search of thousands of digital photos. This discovery has important archaeological implications for analyzing time relationships, monitoring stylistic trends, reconstructing fragmentary artifacts, identifying ancient artisans, and studying the evolution and spread of ancient technologies and styles. It also shows how deep learning models can potentially supplement or supplant traditional typologies in favor of more direct groupings and comparisons of artifacts.},

These clouds usually comprise millions of unrelated points and are not presented in an efficient data structure, making them complicated to use. Furthermore, point clouds do not contain topological or semantic information on the elements they represent. Added to these difficulties is the fact that a variety of different kinds of sensors and measurement methods are used in study and documentation work: photogrammetry, LIDAR, etc. Each point cloud must be fused and integrated so that decisions can be taken based on the total information supplied by all the sensors used. A system must be devised to represent the discrete set of points in order to organise, structure and fuse the point clouds. In this work we propose the concept of multispectral voxels to fuse the point clouds, thus integrating multisensor information in an efficient data structure, and applied it to the real case of a building element in an archaeological context. The use of multispectral voxels for the fusion of point clouds integrates all the multisensor information in their structure.

Mapping the piles of such sites is an indispensable basis to the exploitation of the high resolution absolute chronological data gained through dendrochronology. In a case study at the underwater site of Plo.ca, Mi.cov Grad at Lake Ohrid, North Macedonia, nine consecutive 10 m(2) strips and a 6 m(2) excavation section were uncovered, the situation documented, and the wood piles sampled. The gained data was vectorized in a geographic information system. During two field campaigns, a total of 794 wooden elements on a surface of 96 m(2) could be documented three-dimensionally with a residual error of less than 2 cm. The exceptionally high number of fishes in the 5 m deep water resulted in a significant covering of potentially important information on the relevant photos. We present a machine learning approach, especially developed and successfully applied to the automatic detection and masking of these fishes in order to eliminate them from the images. The discussed documentation workflow enables an efficient, cost-effective, accurate and reproducible mapping of pile fields.

	abstract = {In November of 2019, the company MEDS BV, based in the Netherlands but mainly active in the Americas, initiated experimental aerial remote sensing with airborne LiDAR imagery in the context of a private-public sector collaboration to enable identification of undocumented archaeological sites concealed beneath the high Andean tropical cloud forests in northern Peru's Amazonas Region. Remote sensing fieldwork and post-processing application of Deep Learning methods by MEDS BV specialists, and subsequent analysis of DTM images by archaeologists yielded a remarkably detailed picture of a forest-covered, previously unstudied sector at the extensive archaeological complex of Kuelap called Imperio. At 3000 m above sea level, the Kuelap site complex consists of at least 12 sectors and two cliff cemeteries sprawling 900 hectares along a ridge top above the western banks of the Utcubamba River valley. Kuelap's centerpiece and featured tourist attraction called "La Fortaleza" is a large settlement built atop a massive walled platform a long, prominent ridgetop. The Kuelap complex was probably the most populous locality in the Utcubamba River valley and is attributed to peoples that the Inka and Spaniards called "Chachapoya." Early Spanish settlers left no known written descriptions of the site, nor useful descriptions regarding the region's inhabitants. Consequently- and despite extensive archaeological studies - important questions concerning the political, economic, and religious roles of Kuelap in the region remain unresolved.
The project reported here has primary and secondary objectives, both resulting from multiple stages of data gathering, processing, analysis, and interpretation. The primary goal was to capture high-resolution, three-dimensional georeferenced imagery of archaeological remains hidden beneath the region's dense tropical montane forests and provide sufficient data for a rich preliminary description. This work responds to the urgent need to identify, characterize, and protect such cultural heritage from looting and destructive activities that accompany population growth and deforestation. The second objective emerged as an unexpected bonus, only because of the extraordinary success of the first. Successful imaging of surface details at Imperio provided an extraordinary opportunity to reevaluate previous interpretations of the site, and to offer an alternative novel hypothesis regarding Imperio's history of occupation and particularly the site's special functions. The imagery enabled identification of subtle surface features that we suggest could be overlooked and inadvertently destroyed during conventional ground-level mapping and documentation activities in such complex, overgrown terrain. Many such features are functional elements of a planned drainage system that warrants further study for long-term conservation planning.},

With a deep learning approach for post-mortem interval estimation (ranging from one day to 2000 years) in bones, the estimation can be approximated with high precision. It is challenging to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI) of skeletal remains within a forensic context. As a result of their interactions with the environment, bones undergo several chemical and physical changes after death. So far, multiple methods have been used to follow up on post-mortem changes. There is, however, no definitive way to estimate the PMI of skeletal remains. This research aimed to propose a methodology capable of estimating the PMI using micro-computed tomography measurements of 104 human skeletal remains with PMIs between one day and 2000 years. The present study indicates that micro-computed tomography could be considered an objective and precise method of PMI evaluation in forensic medicine. The measured parameters show a significant difference regarding the PMI for Cort Porosity p {\textless} 0.001, BV/TV p {\textgreater} 0.001, Mean1 p {\textgreater} 0.001 and Mean2 p {\textgreater} 0.005. Using a machine learning approach, the neural network showed an accuracy of 99\% for distinguishing between samples with a PMI of less than 100 years and archaeological samples.},

	abstract = {Geomorphology generally aims to describe and investigate the processes that lead to the formation of landscapes, while geochronology is needed to detect their timing and duration. Due to restrictions on exporting geological samples from Egypt, modern geoscientific studies in the Nile Delta lack the possibility of dating the investigated sediments and geological features by standard techniques such as OSL or AMS C-14; therefore, this study aims to validate a new approach using machine-learning algorithms on portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data. Archaeologically dated sediments from the archaeological excavations of Buto (Tell el-Fara'in; on-site) that pXRF analyses have geochemically characterized serve as training data for running and comparing Neural Nets, Random Forests, and single-decision trees. The established pXRF fingerprints are transferred via machine-learning algorithms to set up a chronology for undated sediments from sediment cores (i.e., the test data) of the nearby surroundings (off-site). Neural Nets and Random Forests work fine in dating sediments and deliver the best classification results compared with single-decision trees, which struggle with outliers and tend to overfit the training data. Furthermore, Random Forests can be modeled faster and are easier to understand than the complex, less transparent Neural Nets. Therefore, Random Forests provide the best algorithm for studies like this. Furthermore, river features east of Kom el-Gir are dated to pre-Ptolemaic times (before 332 B.C.) when Kom el-Gir had possibly not yet been settled. The research in this paper shows the success of close interactions from various scientific disciplines (Geoinformatics, Physical Geography, Archaeology, Ancient History) to decipher landscape evolution in the long-term-settled Nile Delta's environs using machine learning. With the approach's design and the possibility of integrating many other geographical/sedimentological methods, this study demonstrates the potential of the methodological approach to be applied in other geoscientific fields.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) are used as geochemical tracers for paleomobility studies because they display predictable and stable patterns in ecosystems primarily controlled by the underlying geological regimes. While bedrock geology is stable over thousands of years, geomorphological processes can influence the Sr-87/Sr-86 in ecosystems over archeologically relevant timescales. Among these geomorphological processes, the deposition and reworking of volcanic sediments over Quaternary timescales are little studied but could be an important control of Sr-87/Sr-86 variations in many archeological regions. North Patagonia is a key archeological region to address animal and human movements, and an ideal location to test the influence of Quaternary volcanism on Sr-87/Sr-86 variation as it is located downwind of major volcanic centers. In this study, we aim to assess the main environmental and geological controls of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 and to build a high-resolution isoscape using a machine learning regression framework for forthcoming paleomobility studies. We sampled several locations and analyzed different types of samples (N = 94). The ratios show a limited range of variation, which is not related to the bedrock geology. Rather, bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations display a progressive increase going eastward (away from the Andes), following dust aerosol deposition and elevation variations (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.00041). We argue that this trend relates to the deposition and reworking of unradiogenic volcanic sediments by aeolian, fluvial and glacial erosion during the Quaternary. As most of this sediment reworking occurred during glacial periods, the current bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 variations across the study area likely represent a long-term average that varied little during the Holocene. Consequently, our isoscape provides a solid base for Holocene paleomobility studies in North Patagonia and underlines the importance of Quaternary volcanism processes for interpreting Sr-87/Sr-86 data in paleomobility studies in volcanic regions.},

Its restoration had been in the hands of a multidisciplinary team of experts and it had undergone a series of complex procedures. To this end, computational approaches that can support in deciding the most visually appropriate inpainting for very degraded historical items would be helpful as a second objective opinion for the restorers. The present paper thus attempts to put forward a U-Net approach with a perceptual loss for the semantic inpainting of traditional Romanian vests. Images taken of pieces from the collection of the Oltenia Museum in Craiova, along with such images with garments from the Internet, have been given to the deep learning model. The resulting numerical error for inpainting the corrupted parts is adequately low, however the visual similarity still has to be improved by considering further possibilities for finer tuning.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.procs.2021.08.206},
	abstract = {The restoration of archaeological artefacts is naturally utterly important for preserving the cultural heritage. The first step that is undertaken in this process is the chemical analysis of the object, in order to decide the best procedures for its restoration. The gold standard in approximating the concentration of the elements in its composition (in percentages, between 0 and 100) is performed through an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) machine. While this is a non-invasive approach, it comes at substantial financial and training costs, and possible radiation exposure of the investigator. In this context, the present paper explores the potential of a deep learning regression model to give an estimate on the concentration of a given element from stereo microscopy slides of historical artefacts, as an alternative means to the XRF. Two problems with different degrees of complexity are examined in turn. The first one is represented by the consideration of iron objects, where the metal is strongly dominant in the chemical structure. The second comes both as a complement to the other, in order to expose the model also to non-iron items, and as a more difficult task of identifying the degree of copper that is present only as part of an alloy constitution. While for iron the one absolute value prediction of the model is always very close to the XRF approximation, copper has a wider distribution of its concentration among objects, which is more challenging to learn; hence, performance for a singular absolute estimation can rise only with the increase in the amount of data. A window of error acceptability was also implemented and it allows for an approximation that is sufficient for grasping the degree of the metal in the composition that is necessary for the restoration procedures. The findings therefore provide a first step in putting forward a computational support tool that represents a less expensive and less dangerous alternative for approximating the elemental analysis before artefact reinstatement.

Why are we spending important effort and money to create exact digital copies of our pictures, vases, manuscripts, historical archives, early movies and photographs, archeological artefacts, etc.? Why is it important to capture not just the gist and the content of the artefacts, but every minute detail, the texture, the colors, every imperfection, every stain caused by time and handlers that have held and used them across centuries? One possible reason is that the gist and the content of the artefacts are not the only part of them that we are fascinated with. One possible reason is that the stories we want to tell and to be told on these artefacts are about their textures, their colors, their imperfections, their stains.
It is the stories, not the artefacts, that are important. Digitized multimedia content and descriptive metadata are important as long as they allow and integrate derivative works: scholarly treaties, divulgation works, text books at schools, touristic guides, travel magazines, art magazines, cultural magazines, etc., are the means through which people access and enjoy our heritage. Without them, we would be left with boring lists of numbers and names and images. Stories not only represent how specific humans see and think about our artefacts: they are points of view that enrich data with context and interpretation, transforming the boring lists of numbers and names and images into interesting narratives that teach and entertain. As such, they are subjective, and they provide context.
Getting ready to allow, support, expect and even encourage subjectivity and contextualization in our derivative works, in our stories, require that we also organize the data itself, and the descriptive metadata, to be subjective and contextualized and, more important, multiple.
Technologies exist and are plentiful. Yet, few if any datasets and collections of digitized content and descriptive metadata over heritage artefacts are designed and structured from the beginning so as to support and accommodate or handling multiple independent, often inconsistent or contrasting, contextualized points of view over the same asset. We need to learn to embrace complexity and enjoy the disagreements and the scholarly disagreements and conflicts: they represent our understanding of our past much better than monolithic and synthetic points on view and make up for much better and memorable stories, which is what counts.},

The derived information was validated with manually determined velocities and apex points. It was shown that hyperbola extraction by using a threshold and a column connection clustering (C3) algorithm followed by simple hyperbola fitting is the best method, which had a mean velocity error of 0.021 m/ns compared to manual determination. The average 1D velocity-depth distribution derived in 10 ns intervals was in shape comparable to the manually determined one, but had a systematic shift of about 0.01 m/ns towards higher velocities.},

Especially for large-scale linear archaeological sites, such as the Great Wall, it is challenging to obtain systematic and complete identification results through human-computer interpretation. Based on the theory of deep learning, we propose an improved DeepLabv3+ model and conduct a typical application of the Great Wall of the Han dynasty (GWH) in northwest (NW) China using very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery. The main improvements of the DeepLabv3+ model were (1) replacing the encoder module with pre-trained ResNet101 to obtain deeper features, and (2) adding the Dice coefficient to the loss function to improve the accuracy under the unbalanced condition of positive and negative samples. The experimental evaluation reveals that the improved DeepLabv3+ model achieved accuracy of 98.37\%, recall of 98.92\%, F1 of 98.64\%, and intersection over union (IoU) of 97.32\%. Compared with the original model, accuracy, recall, F1, and IoU have improved by 9.03\%, 9.13\%, 9.08\%, and 16.22\%, respectively. Furthermore, the identification results in the test area also indicate that the improved model has good transferability. This study provides an automatic approach for surveying and mapping the GWH and indicates the great potential of deep learning in the identification of linear archaeological traces in RS archaeology.},

	abstract = {Micro-computer tomography (mCT) is increasingly used in Anthropology and Palaeontology to quantify the external and internal osteological characteristics of extant/extinct species. One of the challenging tasks on such data is the accurate segmentation of images into bone and non-bone classes. Many intensity-based segmentation approaches have been proposed to overcome this issue, moving from global-thresholding to robust (semi)automatic methods. However, researchers often resort to laborious manual segmentation when the intensity levels of bone and non-bone material are extremely similar. Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to outperform traditional approaches for image segmentation. Here we propose a novel domain enriched deep network architecture that combines the benefits of deep learning with expert knowledge of bone structure via two components - 1) a representation network capable of extracting features that are more responsive to bone structures and less responsive to non-bone structures, and 2) a segmentation network that utilizes the features obtained from the representation network to perform segmentation. Effective representation filters are obtained through a robust discriminative-features constraint that enables the discovery of novel features and enhances segmentation accuracy. Experiments performed on challenging mCT images of archaeological bones reveal practical merits of our proposal over state-of-the-art alternatives.},

The rise of the Fourth Paradigm for science drives data-intensive computing without preconceived notions regarding at what scale the phenomena or processes of interest operate, or at which level of details meaningful patterns may emerge. While scale is the a priori consideration for theory-driven research to seek ontological and relational affirmations, big data analytics and machine learning embed scale in algorithms and model outputs. In this paper, we examine embedded scale in data-driven machine learning research, connect the embedding scale to scale operating in the general theory of geographic representation in GIS and scaffold our arguments with a study of using machine learning to detect archeological features in drone-collected high-density images.},

The initial construction of the corpus of Chinese archaeological site text is completed for the first time, and the corpus is input into the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Conditional Random Fields (BiLSTM-CRF) entity recognition model and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units with Dual Attention (BiGRU-Dual Attention) relationship extraction model for training. The F1 values of BiLSTM-CRF model and BiGRU-Dual Attention model on the test set reach 87.87\% and 88.05\%, respectively.

	abstract = {A challenging problem in modern archaeology is to automatically identify fragmented heritage objects by their decorative full designs, such as the pottery sherds from Southeastern America. The difficulties of this problem lie in: 1) these pottery sherds are usually fragmented so that each sherd only covers a small portion of its underlying full design; 2) these sherds can be so highly degraded that curves may contain missing segments or become very shallow; and 3) curve patterns may overlap with each other from the making of these potteries. This paper presents a deep-learning based framework for matching a sherd with a database of known designs to find its underlying design. This framework contains three steps: 1) extracting curve pattern using an FCN-based curve pattern segmentation method from the digitized sherd's depth map, 2) matching a sherd with a non-composite (single copy of a design) pattern combining template matching algorithm with a dual-source CNN re-ranking method to find its underlying design, and 3) matching a sherd with a composite (multiple copies of a design) pattern using a Chamfer Matching based method. The framework was evaluated on a set of sherds from the heartland of the paddle-stamping tradition with a subset of known paddle-stamped designs of Pre-colonial southeastern North America. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms.},

We are interested here in the classification of pottery into coiling and spiral types based on their manufacturing techniques. To distinguish between these two techniques, we look for the lines formed by air bubbles embedded in the pottery samples. Current methods make use of bulky systems, such as computerized tomography scanners or synchrotrons. Microwave acquisition and processing offer an interesting alternative, due to the possibility to have compact and portable systems. In this article, we investigate the classification of pottery based on low-terahertz measurements in the D-band. We process the measurements with 3-D fast Fourier transform. The resulting matrix is classified with an artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron, which is optimized with the gray wolf optimizer, a bioinspired algorithm. The first results show that the accuracy reaches up to 99\% using all the acquired spatial and frequency measurements. Then, we optimize the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) measurement system with a critical criterion on accuracy in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we reduce the spatial acquisition but maintain the wideband operation and the results show that the accuracy is between 85\% and 96\%. In the second one, we reduce the spatial acquisition and use a single frequency. For this second scenario, we achieve a classification accuracy, which is between 77\% and 100\%.},

The workshop's plenary lectures were on: i)  viral pandemics and epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean; ii) the impact of  obesity on the outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents; and iii)  COVID-19 and artificial intelligence. Despite the scarcity of evidence from  fossils and remnants, viruses have been recognised as significant causes of  several epidemics in the ancient Mediterranean. Paediatric obesity, a modifiable  critical health risk factor, has been shown to impact on the development,  progression and severity of viral infections. Thus, the prevention of paediatric  obesity should be included in formulating public health policies and  decision-making strategies against emerging global viral threats. During the  current COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence has been used to facilitate  the identification, monitoring and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, it  will play a fundamental role in the surveillance of epidemic-prone infectious  diseases, in the repurposing of older therapies and in the design of novel  therapeutic agents against viral infections. The collaboration between different  medical specialties and other diverse scientific fields, including archaeology,  history, epidemiology, nutritional technologies, mathematics, computer  technology, engineering, medical law and ethics is essential for the successful  management of paediatric viral infections. The current COVID-19 pandemic has  underscored this need, which should be further encouraged in modern medical  education.},

	abstract = {Image reconstruction has received much attention and has advanced in recent years with the rise of deep learning. Deep neural models have been able to perform image-to-image translation by transferring pictorial styles, coloring old photographs or filling in missing parts. This last technique is known as image inpainting and enables restoration of damaged or missing parts of an image or photograph to obtain the complete picture. However, it is not always possible to properly define which parts are missing or to identify where they are missing, as in the case of superimposing new information on an already complete image. In this paper, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a well-known deep learning model, for virtual inpainting restoration of artificial landscape images containing archaeological remains of Greek temples. The network identifies key features determined by the internal logic of the architectural style denoted by the ruins and adds the missing architectural elements to obtain an image of the restored building. Unlike other studies, it does not receive any information on which elements should be added or where. Virtual inpainting restoration is capable of representing a building's envelope but also integrates particular aspects of the building related to the architectural language used for its design. The restoration of the fundamental parts of the classical Greek order was consistent, and the results were evaluated with objective metrics and through a subjective survey between academics and architects. They showed that adding segmented images to the training dataset gives better results.},

In this study, we have implemented two different artificial intelligence image processing methods over two areas of interest near the present-day village of Kophinou in Cyprus, in the Xeros River valley. We have applied a random forest classifier through the Google Earth Engine big data cloud platform and a Single Shot Detector neural network in the ArcGIS Pro environment. For the first case study, the detection was based on red-green-blue (RGB) high-resolution orthophotos. In contrast, a multispectral camera covering both the visible and the near-infrared parts of the spectrum was used in the second area of investigation. The overall results indicate that such an approach can be used in the future as part of ongoing archaeological pedestrian surveys to detect scattered potsherds in areas of archaeological interest, even if pottery shares a very high spectral similarity with the surface.},

	abstract = {Former field systems (FFS) are the most widespread traces of ancient activities in present European landscapes and represent significant perturbations to ecosystems. Through its ability to penetrate forest canopies and detect microlandforms, Airborne Laser Scanning data reveal archaeological relics over large areas, from periods older than the first available Historical Topographic Maps. Mapping these traces from ALS-derived data (e.g. Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) thus allows for a determination of a new temporal baseline in order to evaluate the effects of a longer history on current patterns of biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the ability of traditional machine learning (Random Forest-RF) and deep learning (Fully Connected Networks-FCN) models to detect Medieval Terraced slopes and Ridges and Furrows (RaF) from an ALS-derived DEM in the southern Vosges (1462 km(2)). We used a combination of Local Binary Patterns and topographical metrics to measure properties of FFS and to train detection models. We then assessed the relative performance of each model semantically and spatially. Our results demonstrated the high suitability of our approach for reproducing major trends in the landscape with a high level of similarity between the predicted and reference spatial patterns (Structural Similarity Index - SSIM {\textgreater} 0.75). RF outperformed FCN for Terraced Slopes, whilst minimizing the false positive rate. FCN slightly outperformed RF for the RaF dataset but showed promising abilities to survey unseen data with a low sensitivity to annotation errors. We suggest that this approach has the potential to offer new spatio-temporal possibilities in Historical Ecology studies as a means of automatically detecting past archaeological ecosystems from a landscape to a regional scale.},

In this analysis, the virtual specimen needs to be segmented to separate different parts or materials, a process that normally requires considerable human effort. In the Automated SEgmentation of Microtomography Imaging (ASEMI) project, we developed a tool to automatically segment these volumetric images, using manually segmented samples to tune and train a machine learning model. For a set of four specimens of ancient Egyptian animal mummies we achieve an overall accuracy of 94-98\% when compared with manually segmented slices, approaching the results of off-the-shelf commercial software using deep learning (97-99\%) at much lower complexity. A qualitative analysis of the segmented output shows that our results are close in terms of usability to those from deep learning, justifying the use of these techniques.},

	abstract = {Image matching, as the task of finding correspondences in images, is the upstream component of vision and photogrammetric applications aiming at the reconstruction of 3D scenes, their understanding and comparison. Such applications are of special importance in the context of cultural heritage, as they can support archaeologists to digitally preserve, restore and analyze antiquities, but also to compare their changes over time. The success of deep learning, now firmly established, paired with the evolution of computer hardware, has led to many advances in image processing, including image matching. Despite this progress, image matching still offers challenges, in terms of the matching process itself but also on other practical and technical aspects. This paper gives an overview of the current status of the research in image matching with a particular focus on cultural heritage, presenting both strengths and weaknesses of the most recent approaches by means of visual comparisons on exemplar challenging image pairs. Besides assisting researchers and practitioners in the choice of the most suitable solution for a given task, this analysis also suggests lines of research worth to be investigated by the community in the near future.},

Combined with AI know-how, such capacity provides us with unique opportunities to trace the artists' intentions to communicate particular emotions to the viewer, from those in the deep past c. 25,000 years ago to the contemporary sculpture. Here, we present a computational approach to analyzing facial expressions depicted in artwork of numerous regions, specifically sculptures. We collected a large dataset of sculptures' faces from online collections of various museums and used the existing methods to assign labels to each image. Each instance may have more than one label predicted by different methods, so we treated facial expression recognition as a multi-label classification problem. We designed deep learning-based frameworks using different backbones to categorize facial expressions in sculptures. We also implemented GradCAM to visualize the attributes in each image contributing the most to the predicted labels.},

The methods of field anthropology and histotaphonomy can be useful in gaining a better understanding of the micro-environment in which the dead body decomposed. Based on the example of five graves from the period of the Corded Ware culture, the study aims to determine the conditions in which the bodies of the deceased were found, or how they were postmortem treated. The skeletal remains of four individuals bore traces of deposition in a hollow space. A histological analysis revealed that the decomposition of soft tissues in these individuals must either have been arrested or, in contrast, highly accelerated, since the bone microstructure was not damaged by microorganisms. The decomposition of the bodies could have been accelerated in an open space such as a partially sunken grave with a construction. Alternatively, decomposition could have occurred as the result of higher temperatures in the form of heat or smoke, but also due to a repeatedly water-logged environment. Specific traces exist on skeletal remains for all of these possibilities. A complex taphonomic analysis of the skeletal remains brings new and more detailed information about the circumstances of the burial, significantly expanding the possibilities of interpreting the concept of death in the past.},

	abstract = {Recent research makes it possible to study more precisely what Leonardo da Vinci drew and noted on naval subjects; thus, we can update and complete the proposals produced from 1939 to 1954, mainly by the naval engineer Luigi Tursini. Leonardo's notes, pictures, and drawings related to naval subjects are scattered and incomplete, but we can still identify some trends, which Leonardo followed fairly consistently, as in research programs. Leonardo had a deep self-taught culture; in the nautical field he knew the main classical sources and the Navis (now lost) by Leon Battista Alberti. He was also familiar with the naval machines and weapons proposed by his forerunners, but he developed his knowledge mainly through experiences, which he obtained through observations, interviews and tests. His observations on vessels were complementary to his research on the motions of water and air. He learned how to sail with a lateen sail, moreover he studied the shape of hulls and their resistance to water in relation to the growth of eddies and tacking of a sailboat in comparison to the flight of birds. He developed basic ideas on the best shapes of hulls even with a test tank, anticipating studies begun in the 18th and 19th centuries. Leonardo accurately recorded sea and river crafts of the Tyrrhenian coast, the Milanese shipping canals, the Adda, the Ticino, and Lake Maggiore. His drawings confirm that local Lombard crafts were generally similar to the traditional ones used until the early decades of the 20th century. Leonardo distinguished well the types of hulls, rudders, and rigging, and also made some notes on construction details, but he did not develop these elements; he drew construction details and general plans only for other projects and subjects, but for water crafts he drew only first-hand ideas, sketches that he perhaps planned to develop later. He could have jotted down other naval subjects, but most likely many of his notes were lost. He knew of a boat designed by Filippo Brunelleschi to carry marble and other heavy loads to Florence, but we do not know what it looked like, although some sketches circulated among scholars. Certainly, Leonardo saw and probably noted the parade boats used by the court of Ludovico il Moro around 1490. They were similar to the bucintoro built in 1475 by Luca Fancelli for the Duke of Mantua, a reconstruction of which is proposed here. This article reports the first part of the study; the forthcoming second part will deal of naval machines, common and special warships, underwater solutions and naval weapons.},

Those techniques have become common in archaeology, as well as museums, leading to an increase in their activity. Perhaps, more recent tools, such as machine learning and deep learning, will provide future pathways in cultural heritage from data collected in social networks.

The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts' similarities in the Joconde's semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images.},

We show that the correct use of ML generates models that are accurate because of their data properties, and not because of methodological biasing during training and testing. We also show alternative tools, like ensemble learning, that allows to increase the confidence of accurate models used for differentiating agency in bone breaking. The present work shows how experimental hammerstone-broken long bones and carnivore-broken long bones can be correctly classified with a moderate ({\textgreater}70 \%) to high degree ({\textgreater}80 \%) of accuracy by several ML methods. The results reinforce the confidence with which ML is being applied in Anthropology, and underscore the great improvement of their use for the analytical study of bone breaking in taphonomy.},

In Japan, recent research conducted by using the "impression method" revealed that ceramic vessels belonging to that era contain impressions of plant seeds. Studying these impressions allows archaeologists to better understand the cultural practices of the Jomon people and the path of rice diffusion in Japan. Most of the analysis was conducted by visually inspecting X-ray images. However, results based on using only X-rays are often inconclusive, leading researchers to use other invasive techniques that damage the potsherds. In this paper, we present a method that classifies X-ray images of potsherds by using deep learning. A dataset composed of 1036 images with seven classes was used to evaluate our approach. We generated different models using different CNN architectures and parameters and analyzed them separately. Then, we applied techniques such as ensemble and test-time augmentation to evaluate how such techniques impact our model. The best result was obtained by combining EfficientNetB7 trained with different parameters, achieving a classification rate of 90\%.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in remote sensing and artificial intelligence can potentially revolutionize the automated detection of archaeological sites. However, the challenging task of interpreting remote sensing imagery combined with the intricate shapes of archaeological sites can hinder the performance of computer vision systems. This work presents a computer vision system trained for efficient hillfort detection in remote sensing imagery. Equipped with an adapted multimodal semantic segmentation model, the system integrates LiDAR-derived LRM images and aerial orthoimages for feature fusion, generating a binary mask pinpointing detected hillforts. Post-processing includes margin and area filters to remove edge inferences and smaller anomalies. The resulting inferences are subjected to hard positive and negative mining, where expert archaeologists classify them to populate the training data with new samples for retraining the segmentation model. As the computer vision system is far more likely to encounter background images during its search, the training data are intentionally biased towards negative examples. This approach aims to reduce the number of false positives, typically seen when applying machine learning solutions to remote sensing imagery. Northwest Iberia experiments witnessed a drastic reduction in false positives, from 5678 to 40 after a single hard positive and negative mining iteration, yielding a 99.3\% reduction, with a resulting F-1 score of 66\%. In England experiments, the system achieved a 59\% F1 score when fine-tuned and deployed countrywide. Its scalability to diverse archaeological sites is demonstrated by successfully detecting hillforts and other types of enclosures despite their typical complex and varied shapes. Future work will explore archaeological predictive modelling to identify regions with higher archaeological potential to focus the search, addressing processing time challenges.},

	abstract = {The study of the Copper Age in the Iberian Peninsula uncovers many enigmas, among them the oculated idols. Characterized by their distinctive eye-shaped motifs on long bones, these idols provide a window into the Chalcolithic communities' symbolic world. However, conventional archaeological techniques have fallen short in fully deciphering their narratives. This study uses advanced machine learning techniques to examine the decorative patterns on these oculated idols. We introduce a toolkit called ImageClusterVis, which utilizes computer vision algorithms to extract features more effectively. By applying Gaussian Mixture Models, Spectral Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps, we can identify and classify patterns that are not visible to the human eye. Our approach helps uncover artistic variations and regional differences in the idols that have not been recognized in past research, showcasing the potential of machine learning to reveal new dimensions of ancient art. Lay Summary: The analysis of visual patterns in material artefacts has always been a central part of archaeological practice, but it has typically relied on qualitative methods. With the advent of digital archaeology, there has been a growing interest in developing more objective and quantitative techniques to compare and classify artefacts based on visual attributes. In this article, we present a novel methodology that employs computer vision algorithms and machine learning to extract robust visual descriptors and cluster archaeological images in an unsupervised manner. This study explores the world of Copper Age Iberian oculated idols on long bones by examining their decorative patterns, to uncover new insights into the regional distinctions, and cultural significances of these enigmatic figures, revealing a previously unseen depth to Copper Age society and artistry. This novel research not only advances our understanding of prehistoric Iberian cultures but also sets a new case study for the interdisciplinary application of AI in archaeology.},

An example is the analysis of lithic microdebitage, or knapping debris, that is smaller than 6.3 mm (0.25 in.). So far, scholars have relied on manual approaches that are prone to intra- and interobserver errors. In the following, we present a machine learning-based alternative together with experimental archaeology and dynamic image analysis. We use a dynamic image particle analyzer to measure each particle in experimentally produced lithic microdebitage (N = 5,299) as well as an archaeological soil sample (N = 73,313). We have developed four machine learning models based on Naive Bayes, glmnet (generalized linear regression), random forest, and XGBoost ("Extreme Gradient Boost[ing]") algorithms. Hyperparameter tuning optimized each model. A random forest model performed best with a sensitivity of 83.5\%. It misclassified only 28 or 0.9\% of lithic microdebitage. XGBoost models reached a sensitivity of 67.3\%, whereas Naive Bayes and glmnet models stayed below 50\%. Except for glmnet models, transparency proved to be the most critical variable to distinguish microdebitage. Our approach objectifies and standardizes microdebitage analysis. Machine learning allows studying much larger sample sizes. Algorithms differ, though, and a random forest model offers the best performance so far.},

Archaeological sites are not only significant to local communities, national identities, and modern tourist economies but also provide critical knowledge of past sociocultural interactions, settlement patterns, human-environment relationships, and risk mitigation strategies. While archaeological landscapes and site destruction have remained outside of traditional land use land cover change (LULCC) studies, they are a form of urban and agricultural land use. By conceptualizing archaeological site destruction within land change science, this study provides an innovative approach for assessing "what's left" of historically surveyed archaeological landscapes. Using a Random Forest algorithm and Landsat satellite data, this study quantifies archaeological site destruction attributed to LULCC in Peru's lowerMoche Valley between 1985 and 2020. More than 400 archaeological sites previously recorded during the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project (CCMVP, 1969-1974) are analyzed. Results indicate that less than a quarter of the original CCMVP sites remain on the landscape. The primary drivers of LULCC in the lower Moche Valley include population growth, migration, and government policies, while secondary drivers include heritage values. Positioning archaeological survey data within land change science and integrating machine learning techniques can benefit historic survey reassessments globally and provides significant knowledge of archaeological site destruction and the socioeconomic conditions that underly dynamic landscape changes.},

Investigations have repeatedly found that forest owners often fail to protect these cultural remains and that many are damaged by forestry operations. Current maps of hunting pits are incomplete, and the locations of known pits have poor spatial accuracy. This study investigated whether hunting pits can be automatically mapped using national airborne laser data and deep learning. The best model correctly mapped 70\% of all the hunting pits in the test data with an F1 score of 0.76.

	abstract = {Cultural traces under forests are one of the main problems affecting the identification of archaeological sites in densely forested areas, so it is full of challenges to discover ancient tombs buried under dense vegetation. The covered ancient tombs can be identified by studying the time-series features of the vegetation covering the ancient tombs on the multi-time series remote sensing images because the ancient tombs buried deep underground have long-term underground space structures, which affect the intrinsic properties of the surface soil so that the growth status of the covering vegetation is different from that of the vegetation in the area without ancient tombs. We first use the highly detailed DSM data to select the ancient tombs that cannot be visually distinguished on the optical images. Then, we explored and constructed the temporal features of the ancient tombs under the forest and the non-ancient tombs in the images, such as the radar timing-series features of Sentinel 1 and the multi-spectral and vegetation index timing-series features of Sentinel 2. Finally, based on these features and machine learning, we designed an automatic identification algorithm for ancient tombs under the forest. The method has been validated in Baling Mountain in Jingzhou, China. It is very feasible to automatically identify ancient tombs covered by surface vegetation by using the timing-series features of remote sensing images. Additionally, the identification of large ancient tombs or concentrated ancient tombs is more accurate, and the accuracy is improved after adding radar features. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current limitations and future directions of the method.},

However, there is a critical gap in this field. Many studies conclude with identifying hundreds or even thousands of potential sites, but very few follow through with crucial fieldwork validation to confirm their existence. This research addresses this gap by proposing and implementing a fieldwork validation pipeline. In northern Portugal's Alto Minho region, we employed this pipeline to verify 237 potential burial mounds identified by an AI-powered algorithm. Fieldwork provided valuable information on the optimal conditions for burial mounds and the specific factors that led the algorithm to err. Based on these insights, we implemented two key improvements to the algorithm. First, we incorporated a slope map derived from LiDAR-generated terrain models to eliminate potential burial mound inferences in areas with high slopes. Second, we trained a Vision Transformer model using digital orthophotos of both confirmed burial mounds and previously identified False Positives. This further refines the algorithm's ability to distinguish genuine sites. The improved algorithm was then tested in two areas: the original Alto Minho validation region and the Barbanza region in Spain, where the location of burial mounds was well established through prior field work.},

This paper presents the first segmentation of large-scale surveys of historic masonry using machine learning, using the thirteenth-century Basilica of St Anthony (Padua, Italy) as a case study. Based on a drone survey of the north facade of the building (110 x 70 m), a state-of-the-art non-learning segmentation approach is described and its limitations for historical structures are illustrated. Then, a new workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is presented. The result is a precise mapping of about 300,000 individual bricks showing a large variety of formats and bonds. The automatic surveys are analysed using visual programming language (VPL), enabling a rapid and feature-based identification of building phases and repair interventions. The outcome demonstrates the validity of machine learning for the analysis of historical structures and its potential in the field of heritage.},

	abstract = {Ancient city walls, one of the most notable distinguishing features of Chinese ancient cities, are military defenses constructed of rammed earth. The ancient city walls have considerable study value because they served as the city's boundary and a symbol of power. However, as a result of natural erosion and human activities, many sites have been ruined. Existing optical remote sensing technologies, LiDAR point cloud processing algorithms, and deep learning methods are inadequate for the extraction and segmentation of ancient city wall sites. The novel semantic segmentation method for ancient city wall sites is described in this paper that extracts sites at the pixel level from LiDAR remote sensing data based on deep learning. To begin, the point cloud data collected by airborne laser scanning is processed into DEM data, and the distribution of ancient city walls in the study area is obtained through archaeological survey and expert interpretation. The dataset for deep learning semantic segmentation is then generated using image cropping and data augmentation techniques. Third, implement a U-Net semantic segmentation framework for microtopographic archaeological sites, and predict ancient city wall sites in the testing region after model training. Finally, the deep learning results are optimized using the connected component analysis method, and prediction mistakes such as holes and noise are removed. Taking Jinancheng, the capital city of the Chu kingdom, as an example, the proposed method process can identify and extract the ancient city wall sites at the pixel level, where the evaluation metrics reach 94.12\% (Precision) and 81.38\% (IoU). The experiment results are excellent due to improvement strategies in the dataset generation, model training, and post-processing steps. Thus, this study is significant for the current survey and protection of ancient city wall sites.

	abstract = {PurposeThis paper provides practical advice for archaeologists and heritage specialists wishing to use ML approaches to identify archaeological features in high-resolution satellite imagery (or other remotely sensed data sources). We seek to balance the disproportionately optimistic literature related to the application of ML to archaeological prospection through a discussion of limitations, challenges and other difficulties. We further seek to raise awareness among researchers of the time, effort, expertise and resources necessary to implement ML successfully, so that they can make an informed choice between ML and manual inspection approaches.Design/methodology/approachAutomated object detection has been the holy grail of archaeological remote sensing for the last two decades. Machine learning (ML) models have proven able to detect uniform features across a consistent background, but more variegated imagery remains a challenge. We set out to detect burial mounds in satellite imagery from a diverse landscape in Central Bulgaria using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus additional but low-touch training to improve performance. Training was accomplished using MOUND/NOT MOUND cutouts, and the model assessed arbitrary tiles of the same size from the image. Results were assessed using field data.FindingsValidation of results against field data showed that self-reported success rates were misleadingly high, and that the model was misidentifying most features. Setting an identification threshold at 60\% probability, and noting that we used an approach where the CNN assessed tiles of a fixed size, tile-based false negative rates were 95-96\%, false positive rates were 87-95\% of tagged tiles, while true positives were only 5-13\%. Counterintuitively, the model provided with training data selected for highly visible mounds (rather than all mounds) performed worse. Development of the model, meanwhile, required approximately 135 person-hours of work.Research limitations/implicationsOur attempt to deploy a pre-trained CNN demonstrates the limitations of this approach when it is used to detect varied features of different sizes within a heterogeneous landscape that contains confounding natural and modern features, such as roads, forests and field boundaries. The model has detected incidental features rather than the mounds themselves, making external validation with field data an essential part of CNN workflows. Correcting the model would require refining the training data as well as adopting different approaches to model choice and execution, raising the computational requirements beyond the level of most cultural heritage practitioners.Practical implicationsImproving the pre-trained model's performance would require considerable time and resources, on top of the time already invested. The degree of manual intervention required - particularly around the subsetting and annotation of training data - is so significant that it raises the question of whether it would be more efficient to identify all of the mounds manually, either through brute-force inspection by experts or by crowdsourcing the analysis to trained - or even untrained - volunteers. Researchers and heritage specialists seeking efficient methods for extracting features from remotely sensed data should weigh the costs and benefits of ML versus manual approaches carefully.
Social implicationsOur literature review indicates that use of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML approaches to archaeological prospection have grown exponentially in the past decade, approaching adoption levels associated with "crossing the chasm" from innovators and early adopters to the majority of researchers. The literature itself, however, is overwhelmingly positive, reflecting some combination of publication bias and a rhetoric of unconditional success. This paper presents the failure of a good-faith attempt to utilise these approaches as a counterbalance and cautionary tale to potential adopters of the technology. Early-majority adopters may find ML difficult to implement effectively in real-life scenarios.Originality/valueUnlike many high-profile reports from well-funded projects, our paper represents a serious but modestly resourced attempt to apply an ML approach to archaeological remote sensing, using techniques like transfer learning that are promoted as solutions to time and cost problems associated with, e.g. annotating and manipulating training data. While the majority of articles uncritically promote ML, or only discuss how challenges were overcome, our paper investigates how - despite reasonable self-reported scores - the model failed to locate the target features when compared to field data. We also present time, expertise and resourcing requirements, a rarity in ML-for-archaeology publications.},

	abstract = {Archeological textiles can provide invaluable insight into the past. However, they are often highly fragmented, and a puzzle has to be solved to re-assemble the object and recover the original motifs. Unlike common jigsaw puzzles, archeological fragments are highly damaged, and no correct solution to the puzzle is known. Although automatic puzzle solving has fascinated computer scientists for a long time, this work is one of the first attempts to apply modern machine learning solutions to archeological textile re-assembly. First and foremost, it is important to know which fragments belong to the same object. Therefore, features are extracted from digital images of textile fragments using color statistics, classical texture descriptors, and deep learning methods. These features are used to conduct clustering and identify similar fragments. Four different case studies with increasing complexity are discussed in this article: from well-preserved textiles with available ground truth to an actual open problem of Oseberg archeological tapestry with unknown solution. This work reveals significant knowledge gaps in current machine learning, which helps us to outline a future avenue toward more specialized application-specific models.},

Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is proposed as the main technology for this initial investigation. In fact, SAR is the only satellite-based technology able to detect buried artefacts from space, and it is expected that fine-resolution images of ALOS/PALSAR-2 (L-band SAR) would be able to detect large features ({\textgreater}1 m) that might be buried in the subsurface ({\textless}2 m) under optimum conditions, i.e., dry and bare soil. SAR data were complemented with very high-resolution Worldview-3 multispectral images (0.31 m panchromatic, 1.24 m VNIR) to obtain a visual assessment of the study area and its land cover features. An integrated approach, featuring the application of advanced image processing techniques and geospatial analysis using machine learning, was adopted to characterise the site while automating the process and investigating its applicability. Results from SAR feature extraction and geospatial analyses showed detection of the areas on the site that were already under excavation and predicted new, hitherto unexplored archaeological areas. The validation of these results was performed using previous archaeological works as well as geological and geomorphological field surveys. The modelling and prediction accuracies are expected to improve with the insertion of a neural network and backpropagation algorithms based on the performed cluster groups following more recent field surveys. The validated results can provide guidance for future on-site archaeological work. The pilot process developed in this work can therefore be applied to similar arid environments for the detection of archaeological features and guidance of on-site investigations.},

	abstract = {Archaeological parks represent one of the most important cultural resources for a nation. Archaeological parks safeguard, conserve, manage, and defend their archaeological, architectural, environmental, and landscape heritage. An Archaeological Park experiences very complex operational dynamics: for example, visitors often come into direct contact with artistic artifacts and, even unintentionally, can damage them. In addition, Archaeological Parks are usually outdoors; therefore, their cultural assets are subjected to environmental influences such as rain, wind, sun, and weeds. New technologies can effectively support monitoring activities. This paper will present an approach that aims to identify and classify potential critical issues within an Archaeological Park in an automated manner and to communicate these issues to the various actors in the reference scenarios. The reference scenario for this activity is the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, which cyclically produces high-definition images of its artistic resources using aerial drones. In particular, on a fortnightly basis, high-definition orthophotos of the park and its artistic artifacts are produced. It is understood that the entire operation is time-consuming and does not allow for Real-Time maintenance. Therefore, the research's objective is to automate this process by introducing Machine Learning techniques for automatically identifying and classifying problems in the image and implementing a mechanism for notifying park personnel. The methodology is based on using deep learning systems capable of identifying and classifying potential issues. The YoloV7 library was used to detect the issues in the images.},

Current archaeology depends on trained experts to carry out bronze dating, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

To achieve this, we first collect a large-scale image dataset of bronze dings, which contains richer attribute information than other existing fine-grained datasets. Second, we introduce a multihead classifier and a knowledge-guided relation graph to mine the relationship between attributes and the ding era. Third, we conduct comparison experiments with various existing methods, the results of which show that our dating method achieves a state-of-the-art performance.

Deep learning models, a subset of machine learning, are harnessed to analyze a comprehensive collection of 10,000 photographs showcasing Dunhuang cave murals spanning various historical periods. Researchers skillfully identify minor shifts in artistic patterns, meticulously recording the dynamic interplay of Indian, Central Asian, Chinese, and Tibetan influences on Dunhuang art, all through the integration of big data approaches with archaeological evidence.

It not only extends the legacy of RSA but also signifies a shift in both the implication and methodology of sensing-based archaeological prospecting.

Over the last decade, the increased use of remote sensing sensors and their products for archaeological science and cultural heritage studies has been reported in the literature. Therefore, different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to recognise archaeological remains or map environmental changes over time. Recently, more thorough object detection approaches have been adopted by researchers for the automated detection of surface ceramics. In this study, we applied several supervised machine learning classifiers using red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral high-resolution drone imageries over a simulated archaeological area to evaluate their performance towards semi-automatic surface ceramic detection. The overall results indicated that low-altitude remote sensing sensors and advanced image processing techniques can be innovative in archaeological research. Nevertheless, the study results also pointed out existing research limitations in the detection of surface ceramics, which affect the detection accuracy. The development of a novel, robust methodology aimed to address the "accuracy paradox" of imbalanced data samples for optimising archaeological surface ceramic detection. At the same time, this study attempted to fill a gap in the literature by blending AI methodologies for non-uniformly distributed classes. Indeed, detecting surface ceramics using RGB or multi-spectral drone imageries should be reconsidered as an 'imbalanced data distribution' problem. To address this paradox, novel approaches need to be developed.},

The historical significance of tar production, an important livelihood for centuries, has had extensive environmental and ecological impacts, particularly in the thinly inhabited northern and eastern parts of Finland. Despite being one of the most widespread archaeological features in the country, tar kilns have received relatively little attention until recently. The authors employed a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) U-Net-based algorithm to detect these features from the ALS data, which proved to be more accurate, faster, and capable of covering systematically larger spatial areas than human actors. It also produces more consistent, replicable, and ethically sustainable results. This semi-automated approach enabled the efficient location of a vast number of previously unknown archaeological features, significantly increasing the number of tar kilns in each study area compared to the previous situation. This has implications also for the cultural resource management in Finland. The authors' findings have influenced the preparation of the renewal of the Finnish Antiquities Act, raising concerns about the perceived impacts on cultural heritage management and land use sectors due to the projected tenfold increase in archaeological site detection using deep learning algorithms. The use of environmental remote sensing data may provide a means of examining the long-term cultural and ecological impacts of tar production in greater detail. Our pilot studies suggest that artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize archaeological research and cultural resource management in Finland, offering promising avenues for future exploration.},

This paper explores the use of airborne LiDAR data and data-centric artificial intelligence for identifying potential burial mounds. The challenge of exploring the landscape and mapping new archaeological sites, coupled with the difficulty of identifying them through visual analysis of remote sensing data, results in the recurring issue of insufficient annotations. Additionally, the top-down nature of LiDAR data hinders artificial intelligence in its search, as the morphology of archaeological sites blends with the morphology of natural and artificial shapes, leading to a frequent occurrence of false positives. To address this problem, a novel data-centric artificial intelligence approach is proposed, exploring the available data and tools. The LiDAR data is pre-processed into a dataset of 2D digital elevation images, and the known burial mounds are annotated. This dataset is augmented with a copy-paste object embedding based on Location-Based Ranking. This technique uses the Land-Use and Occupation Charter to segment the regions of interest, where burial mounds can be pasted. YOLOv5 is trained on the resulting dataset to propose new burial mounds. These proposals go through a post-processing step, directly using the 3D data acquired by the LiDAR to verify if its 3D shape is similar to the annotated sites. This approach drastically reduced false positives, attaining a 72.53\% positive rate, relevant for the ground-truthing phase where archaeologists visit the coordinates of proposed burial mounds to confirm their existence.},

Following the Last Glacial Maximum, sea levels rose by 120 m globally, and vast, habitable landscapes were lost to the sea. These landscapes were inaccessible until extensive remote sensing datasets were provided by the offshore energy sector. In this paper, we provide the results of a research programme centred on AI applications using data from the southern North Sea. Here, an area of c. 188,000 km2 of habitable terrestrial land was inundated between c. 20,000 BP and 7000 BP, along with the cultural heritage it contained. As part of this project, machine learning tools were applied to detect and interpret features with potential archaeological significance from shallow seismic data. The output provides a proof-of-concept model demonstrating verifiable results and the potential for a further, more complex, leveraging of AI interpretation for the study of submarine palaeolandscapes.},

	abstract = {Many Maya archaeological areas are not comprehensively or systematically mapped because ruins, often hidden under tropical forest canopy in rugged terrain, can take decades to locate, identify, and map. Recent years have seen an explosion of lidar data collection, and machine learning provides a way to exploit these lidar data, making feature analyses more efficient and consistently executed. At present, there are a limited number of small, area-specific models that exist for the Maya area, the largest of which covers 230 km 2 . Here we present the foundation for a broadscale, multi-area-based convolutional neural network (CNN) object detection model that uses airborne laser scanning data, or lidar, for archaeological feature detection across 615 km 2 of the Maya area, as well as preliminary results from an additional 885 km 2 test area. This sets the path for a model that will enable researchers to map archaeological areas across the entire Maya Lowland area in weeks or months instead of decades. Notably, we find that a model trained on multiple areas with significantly different topographies produces better results for all areas as compared to a model trained on a single area. The broadscale model here presented produced an F1 score of 0.80. Results also include many potential new structure detections, including detections on lidar at an archaeological area that has not yet been comprehensively ground-surveyed and is located in an entirely different country in the Maya Lowlands from where the model was trained on. This model represents an attempt at a broadscale machine learning approach for archaeological feature mapping in the Maya area and demonstrates how big data can be integrated into traditional archaeological workflows. Lidar has already shown much greater ancient Maya infrastructure throughout the Maya world and elsewhere in the tropics, and this study using machine learning with lidar is showing even greater Maya infrastructure through vast areas of the Maya tropical forest.},

In this study, we introduce IArch, a tool that enables eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) data analytics for archaeologists without requiring specific programming skills. It specifically allows data analysis performed to either validate existing data-supported hypotheses or generate new ones. The tool covers the entire workflow for applying ML, from data processing to explaining the final results. The tool allows the use of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, as well as the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to provide archaeologists with global and individual explanations for the predictions.

To facilitate the digital preservation and protection of these  Shang and Chow bronze artifacts (SCB), it becomes imperative to categorize their  decorative patterns. Therefore, a SCB pattern classification method of  differential evolution called Shang and Chow Bronze Convolutional Neural Network  (SCB-CNN) is proposed. Firstly, the original bronze decorative patterns of Shang  and Chow dynasties are collected, and the samples are expanded through image  augmentation technology to form a training dataset. Secondly, based on the  classical convolutional neural network structure, the recognition and  classification of bronze patterns are implemented by adjusting the network  parameters. Then, the initial parameters of the convolutional neural network are  optimized by differential evolution algorithm, and the optimized SCB-CNN is  simulated. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted between the optimized  SCB-CNN, the unoptimized model, VGG-Net, and GoogleNet. The experimental results  indicate that the optimized SCB-CNN significantly reduces training time while  maintaining fast prediction speed, convergence speed, and high accuracy. This  study provides new insights for the inheritance and innovation research of SCB  patterns.},

	abstract = {AIMS: We contribute to the methodological literature on the assessment of health inequalities by applying an algorithmic approach to evaluate the capabilities of  socioeconomic variables in predicting the prevalence of non-communicable diseases  in a Norwegian health survey. METHODS: We use data from the seventh survey of the  population based Tromsø Study (2015-2016), including 11,074 women and 10,009 men  aged 40 years and above. We apply the random forest algorithm to predict four  non-communicable disease outcomes (heart attack, cancer, diabetes and stroke)  based on information on a number of social root causes and health behaviours. We  evaluate our results using the classification error, the mean decrease in  accuracy, partial dependence statistics. RESULTS: Results suggest that education,  household income and occupation to a variable extent contribute to predicting  non-communicable disease outcomes. Prediction misclassification ranges between  25.1\% and 35.4\% depending on the non-communicable diseases under study. Partial  dependences reveal mostly expected health gradients, with some examples of  complex functional relationships. Out-of-sample model validation shows that  predictions translate to new data input. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithmic modelling can  provide additional empirical detail and metrics for evaluating heterogeneous  inequalities in morbidity. The extent to which education, income and occupation  contribute to predicting binary non-communicable disease outcomes depends on both  non-communicable diseases and socioeconomic indicator. Partial dependences reveal  that social gradients in non-communicable disease outcomes vary in shape between  combinations of non-communicable disease outcome and socioeconomic status  indicator. Misclassification rates highlight the extent of variation within  socioeconomic groups, suggesting that future studies may improve predictive  accuracy by exploring further subpopulation heterogeneity.},

Here, we report the deployment of an AI system to the entire Nazca region, a  UNESCO World Heritage site, leading to the discovery of 303 new figurative  geoglyphs within only 6 mo of field survey, nearly doubling the number of known  figurative geoglyphs. Even with limited training examples, the developed AI  approach is demonstrated to be effective in detecting the smaller relief-type  geoglyphs, which unlike the giant line-type geoglyphs are very difficult to  discern. The improved account of figurative geoglyphs enables us to analyze their  motifs and distribution across the Nazca Pampa. We find that relief-type  geoglyphs depict mainly human motifs or motifs of things modified by humans, such  as domesticated animals and decapitated heads (81.6\%). They are typically located  within viewing distance (on average 43 m) of ancient trails that crisscross the  Nazca Pampa and were most likely built and viewed at the individual or  small-group level. On the other hand, the giant line-type figurative geoglyphs  mainly depict wild animals (64\%). They are found an average of 34 m from the  elaborate linear/trapezoidal network of geoglyphs, which suggests that they were  probably built and used on a community level for ritual activities.},

	abstract = {Estimation of age-at-death from human skeletal remains is fundamental in forensic anthropology as part of the construction of the biological profile of the  individual under study. At the same time, skeletal age-at-death estimation in  adults is problematic due to the disparity between chronological and biological  age, the important inter-individual variability at the rate of skeletal aging,  and inherent biases in the available methodologies (e.g., age mimicry). A recent  paper proposed a method for skeletal age-at-death estimation based on multiple  anatomical traits and machine learning. A software was also created, DRNNAGE, for  the easy implementation of this method. The authors of that study supported that  their methods have very high repeatability and reproducibility, and the mean  absolute error of the age estimation was {\textasciitilde}6 years across the entire adult age  span, which is particularly high and promising. This paper tests the proposed  methodology on a modern documented Greek sample of 219 adult individuals from the  Athens Collection, with age-at-death from 19 to 99 years old. The sample was  split into males and females as well as into individuals under and over 50 years  old. We also divided the sample in 10-year intervals. First, intra- and  inter-observer error was estimated in order to assess repeatability and  reproducibility of the variables employed for age-at-death estimation. Then, the  validity (correct classification performance) of DRNNAGE for each anatomical  region individually, as well as all combined, was evaluated on each demographic  separately and on the pooled sample. According to the results, some of the  variables showed very low repeatability and reproducibility, thus their use  should be cautious. The DRNNAGE software showed overall highly accurate  age-at-death estimates for individuals older than 50 years, but poor on younger  adults, with only exception the cranial sutures, which performed surprisingly  well for all age groups. Overall, these results support the importance of  cross-validation and the use of population-specific methods in forensic  anthropology.},

His  genetic profile and physical characteristics, including his appearance and  potential diseases, have garnered significant interest from the academic  community and the public. In this study, we have successfully generated a  0.343×-coverage genome of Wudi with 1,011,419 single-nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) on the 1240k panel. By analyzing pigmentation-relevant SNPs and conducting  cranial CT-based facial reconstruction, we have determined that Wudi possessed a  typical East or Northeast Asian appearance. Furthermore, pathogenic SNPs suggest  Wudi faced an increased susceptibility to certain diseases, such as stroke. Wudi  shared the closest genetic relationship with ancient Khitan and Heishui Mohe  samples and modern Daur and Mongolian populations but also showed additional  affinity with Yellow River (YR) farmers. We estimated that Wudi derived 61\% of  his ancestry from ancient Northeast Asians (ANAs) and nearly one-third from YR  farmer-related groups. This can likely be attributed to continuous intermarriage  between Xianbei royal families, and local Han aristocrats.(1)(,)(2) Furthermore,  our study has revealed genetic diversities among available ancient Xianbei  individuals from different regions, suggesting that the formation of the Xianbei  was a dynamic process influenced by admixture with surrounding populations.},

However, the inherent  limitations of traditional interpolation methods and emerging machine-learning  techniques restrict their spatial prediction accuracy. This study aimed to refine  the spatial prediction of heavy metal distributions in Guangxi, China, by  integrating machine learning models and spatial regionalization indices (SRIs).  The results demonstrated that random forest (RF) models incorporating SRIs  outperformed artificial neural network and support vector regression models,  achieving R(2) values exceeding 0.96 for eight heavy metals on the test data.  Hierarchical clustering for feature selection further improved the model  performance. The optimized RF models accurately predicted the heavy metal  distributions in agricultural soils across the province, revealing higher levels  in the central-western regions and lower levels in the north and south. Notably,  the models identified that 25.78 \% of agricultural soils constitute hotspots with  multiple co-occurring heavy metals, and over 6.41 million people are exposed to  excessive soil heavy metal levels.

Here, we report genome-wide data from 11  human samples from the Gaoshan and Haimenkou sites with mixed farming of millet  and rice dating to between 4,500 and 3,000 years before present in southwest  China. The two ancient groups derived approximately 90\% of their ancestry from  the Neolithic Yellow River farmers, suggesting a demic diffusion of millet  farming to southwest China. We inferred their remaining ancestry to be derived  from a Hòabìnhian-related hunter-gatherer lineage. We did not detect rice  farmer-related ancestry in the two ancient groups, which indicates that they  likely adopted rice farming without genetic assimilation. We, however, observed  rice farmer-related ancestry in the formation of some present-day Tibeto-Burman  populations. Our results suggested the occurrence of both demic and cultural  diffusion in the development of Neolithic mixed farming in some parts of  southwest China.},

	abstract = {Bullet ricochets are common occurrences during shooting incidents and can provide a wealth of information useful for shooting incident reconstruction. However,  there have only been a small number of studies that have systematically  investigated bullet ricochet impact site morphology. Here, this study reports on  an experiment that examined the plan-view morphology of 297 ricochet impact sites  in concrete that were produced by five different bullet types shot from two  distances. This study used a random forest machine learning algorithm to classify  bullet types with morphological dimensions of the ricochet mark (impact) with  length and perimeter-to-area ratio emerging as the top predictor variables. The  0.22 LR leaves the most distinctive impact mark on the concrete, and overall, the  classification accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation is 62\%, considerably  higher than a random classification accuracy of 20\%. Adding in distance to the  model as a predictor increases the classification accuracy to 66\%. These initial  results are promising, in that they suggest that an unknown bullet type can  potentially be determined, or at least probabilistically assessed, from the  morphology of the ricochet impact site alone. However, the substantial amount of  overlap this study documented among distinct bullet types' ricochet mark  morphologies under highly controlled conditions and with machine learning  suggests that the human identification of ricochet marks in real-world shooting  incident reconstructions may be on occasion, or perhaps regularly, in error. KEY  POINTS: Bullet ricochet impact sites can help with shooting incident  reconstruction.A random forest machine learning algorithm classified bullet type  from ricochet morphology.Results suggest that unknown bullets can potentially be  determined from ricochet impact site morphology.Human identification of bullet  types from ricochet sites may be erroneous.},

Consequently, they are commonly featured in  global debates surrounding societal collapse. Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is often  used as an example of how overexploitation of limited resources resulted in a  catastrophic population collapse. A vital component of this narrative is that the  rapid rise and fall of pre-contact Rapanui population growth rates was driven by  the construction and overexploitation of once extensive rock gardens. However,  the extent of island-wide rock gardening, while key for understanding food  systems and demography, must be better understood. Here, we use shortwave  infrared (SWIR) satellite imagery and machine learning to generate an island-wide  estimate of rock gardening and reevaluate previous population size models for  Rapa Nui. We show that the extent of this agricultural infrastructure is  substantially less than previously claimed and likely could not have supported  the large population sizes that have been assumed.},

Considering water quality parameters and both the delayed and instantaneous  effects of meteorological factors, ensemble learning, and quasi-Monte Carlo  methods were employed to predict daily algal cell density (AD) between January  2021 and January 2024. Consistently, superior predictive accuracy across all  three clusters was exhibited by the Stacking-Elastic-Net regularization model.  Furthermore, the minimum combination of drivers that achieved near-optimal  accuracy for each cluster was identified, striking a balance between accuracy and  cost. The ranking of the effect of drivers on AD varied by cluster, while the  delayed effect of meteorological factors on AD generally outweighed their  instantaneous effect for all clusters. Additionally, the heterogeneous or  homogeneous thresholds and responses between drivers and AD were explored. These  findings could serve as a scientific and cost-effective basis for government  agencies to develop regional sustainable strategies for managing water quality.},

Hominins and other mammal carnivores have been  co-evolving, at least during the past two million years, and their potential  interactions determined the evolution of human behavior. In order to understand  all this, taxon-specific carnivore agency must be effectively identified in the  fossil record. Until now, taphonomists have been able to determine, to some  degree, hominin and carnivore inputs in site formation, and their interactions in  the modification of part of those assemblages. However, the inability to  determine agency more specifically has hampered the development of taphonomic  research, whose methods are virtually identical to those used several decades ago  (lagged by a high degree of subjectivity). A call for more objective and  agent-specific methods would be a major contribution to the advancement of  taphonomic research. Here, we present one of these advances. The use of computer  vision (CV) on a large data set of images of tooth marks has enabled the  objective discrimination of taxon-specific carnivore agency up to 88\% of the  testing sample. We highlight the significance of this method in an  interdisciplinary interplay between traditional taphonomic-paleontological  analysis and artificial intelligence-based computer science. The new questions  that can be addressed with this will certainly bring important changes to several  ideas on important aspects of the human evolutionary process.},

We assessed the discrimination accuracy for an unsupervised and  supervised learning pipeline, i.e. with principal component analysis (PCA) and  linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature extraction, when tasked with the  classification of extant primates. The trained algorithm is used to classify a  sample of known fossil hominoids. For the visualization, PCA and uniform manifold  approximation and projection (UMAP) are used. The results show that the  discriminant function correctly classified the extant specimens with an F1-score  of 0.90 for both PCA and LDA. In addition, the classification of fossil hominoids  reflects taxonomy and locomotor behaviour reported in literature. This  classification based on shape data using PCA and LDA is a powerful tool that can  discriminate between the triquetrum shape of extant primates with high accuracy  and quantitatively compare fossil and extant morphology. It can be used to  support taxonomic differentiation and aid the further interpretation of fossil  remains. Further testing is necessary by including other bones and more species  and specimens per species extinct primates.},

The aim was to explore and share experience and  ethical considerations regarding the management and identification of human  remains in the event of disasters, with the purpose to arrive at a general  consensus about what constitutes the ethical foundation of the management of  unidentified human remains in forensic practice and, in particular,  contextualizing this in India. The main ethical consideration that emerged was  tracing the missing and identifying the dead are crucial to maintaining or  restoring basic human rights and responsible relief activities. Identification is  not only an organizational and scientific achievement but, regardless of  circumstances, also necessarily and always an activity with significant  political, epistemic, and philosophical relevance and consequence. In India, it  could be important to consider new legal provisions for the management of human  samples so that this would provide a starting point for the treatment of human  remains managed for forensic purposes with uniformity in the country. Another  important step in which governments should take part regards the involvement and  education of the general public to develop their interest in this important goal.  In the field of forensic anthropology, artificial intelligence can support,  through the use of algorithms, the decision-making process that leads to the  identification of the victim or its remains. Furthermore, they can be used to  extract new knowledge from huge databases and shorten identification through  computer automation of data binding activities. Applying artificial intelligence  tools in forensic sciences to collect new information from massive datasets to  enhance knowledge, and reduce human subjectivity and errors, provides a greater  scientific basis that could improve the strength of the evidence and support the  admissibility of expert evidence. In light of the general lack of  national/international guidance about ethical oversight for identification and  care of human remains, the fact that regulations are frequently not adequate to  govern ethical aspects, we hope that an internationally recognized body should  develop such guidance in collaboration with relevant organizations.},

This paper  introduces geoFOR, a web-based collaborative application that utilizes ArcGIS and  machine learning to deliver improved PMI predictions. The geoFOR application  provides a standardized, collaborative forensic taphonomy database that gives  practitioners a readily available tool to enter case information that automates  the collection of environmental data and delivers a PMI prediction using  statistically robust methods. After case submission, the cross-validating machine  learning PMI predictive model results in a R² value of 0.82. Contributors receive  a predicted PMI with an 80\% confidence interval. The geoFOR database currently  contains 2529 entries from across the U.S. and includes cases from medicolegal  investigations and longitudinal studies from human decomposition facilities. We  present the overall findings of the data collected so far and compare results  from medicolegal cases and longitudinal studies to highlight previously poorly  understood limitations involved in the difficult task of PMI estimation. This  novel approach for building a reference dataset of human decomposition is  forensically and geographically representative of the realities in which human  remains are discovered which allows for continual improvement of PMI estimations  as more data is captured. It is our goal that the geoFOR data repository follow  the principles of Open Science and be made available to forensic researchers to  test, refine, and improve PMI models. Mass collaboration and data sharing can  ultimately address enduring issues associated with accurately estimating the PMI  within medicolegal death investigations.},

However,  although both CA and BA belong to high geological background areas, the mobility  of soil Cd differs significantly between them. In addition to the difficulty in  reaching the parent material in deep soil, it is challenging to perform land use  planning in high geological background areas. This study attempts to determine  the key soil geochemical parameters related to the spatial patterns of lithology  and the main factors influencing the geochemical behavior of soil Cd, and  ultimately uses them and machine-learning methods to identify CA and BA. In  total, 10,814 and 4323 surface soil samples were collected from CA and BA,  respectively. Hot spot analysis revealed that soil properties and soil Cd were  significantly correlated with the underlying bedrock, except for TOC and S.  Further research confirmed that the concentration and mobility of Cd in high  geological background areas were mainly affected by pH and Mn. The soil parent  materials were then predicted using artificial neural network (ANN), random  forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. The ANN and RF models showed  higher Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies than those of the SVM model,  suggesting that ANNs and RF have the potential to predict soil parent materials  from soil data, which might help in ensuring safe land use and coordinating  activities in high geological background areas.},

This proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the  possibility to develop a deep learning algorithm for sex estimation even from a  single peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) slice of the fourth  lumbar vertebra (L4). The study utilized a total of 117 vertebrae from the Terry  Anatomical Collection. There were 58 male and 59 female cadavers, all of the  white ethnicity, with the average age at death 49 years and a range of 24 to  77 years. A coronal pQCT scan was taken from the midway of the L4 corpus. Sex  estimation was performed in a total of 19 neural network architectures  implemented in the AIDeveloper software. Of the explored architectures, a  LeNet5-based algorithm reached the highest accuracy of 86.4\% in the test set.  Sex-specific classification rates were 90.9\% among males and 81.8\% among females.  This preliminary finding advances the field by encouraging and directing future  research on artificial intelligence-based methods in sex estimation from  individual skeletal traits such as the vertebrae.

	abstract = {Sex estimation is a necessary part of forensic and osteological analyses of skeletal human remains in the construction of a biological profile. Several  skeletal traits are sexually dimorphic and used for skeletal sex estimation. The  human mandible and morphological traits therein have been long used for sex  estimation, but the validity of using the mandible in this purpose has become a  concern. In this study, we examined the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)  and especially deep learning (DL) to provide accurate sex estimations from the  mandible. We used 193 modern South African mandibles from the Human Osteological  Research Collection (HORC) in the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences university with  known sex to conduct our study. All mandibles were photographed from the same  angle and the photographs were analyzed with an open-source DL software. The  best-performing DL algorithm estimated the sex of males with 100\% accuracy and  females with 76.9\% accuracy. However, further studies with a higher number of  specimens could provide more reliable validity for using AI when building the  biological profile from skeletal remains.},

	abstract = {Although knee measurements yield high classification rates in metric sex estimation, there is a paucity of studies exploring the knee in artificial  intelligence-based sexing. This proof-of-concept study aimed to develop deep  learning algorithms for sex estimation from radiographs of reconstructed cadaver  knee joints belonging to the Terry Anatomical Collection. A total of 199 knee  radiographs were obtained from 100 skeletons (46 male and 54 female cadavers;  mean age at death 64.2 years, range 50-102 years) whose tibiofemoral joints were  reconstructed in standard anatomical position. The AIDeveloper software was used  to train, validate, and test neural network architectures in sex estimation based  on image classification. Of the explored algorithms, an MhNet-based model reached  the highest overall testing accuracy of 90.3\%. The model was able to classify all  females (100.0\%) and most males (78.6\%) correctly. These preliminary findings  encourage further research on artificial intelligence-based methods in sex  estimation from the knee joint. Combining radiographic data with automated and  externally validated algorithms may establish valuable tools to be utilized in  forensic anthropology.},

	abstract = {Noncoding DNA is central to our understanding of human gene regulation and complex diseases(1,2), and measuring the evolutionary sequence constraint can  establish the functional relevance of putative regulatory elements in the human  genome(3-9). Identifying the genomic elements that have become constrained  specifically in primates has been hampered by the faster evolution of noncoding  DNA compared to protein-coding DNA(10), the relatively short timescales  separating primate species(11), and the previously limited availability of  whole-genome sequences(12). Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239  species, representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order.  Using this resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under  selective constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5\% false discovery  rate. We detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410  transcription factor binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates  but not across other placental mammals and validate their cis-regulatory effects  on gene expression. These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic  variants that affect gene expression and complex traits and diseases. Our results  highlight the important role of recent evolution in regulatory sequence elements  differentiating primates, including humans, from other placental mammals.},

	abstract = {High-impact practices (HIPs) are educational modalities that focus on experiential and deep learning to affect student success in higher education,  particularly among students matriculating from historically underserved  communities. HIPs are designed to provide students with the intellectual and  practical skills to succeed in an increasingly unstable global world beyond  college. Utilizing a private-public partnership forensic archeological contract  project, this paper examines how this venture employed a HIP-based contractor  model that hired students as a professional archeological field crew and provided  them with a living wage, transportation, and room and board. It also provided  students without the means to participate in international fieldwork with the  wherewithal to do so, supporting underserved students and diversity, equity,  inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives. Utilizing this HIP-based contract  model resulted in greater student investment and collaboration in a fieldwork  situation more akin to the real world, where students learned to solve problems,  communicate, and network in an international setting, resulting in new  opportunities, such as professional jobs, and academic projects and publications.  The paid contractor model ensured students with limited resources could  participate, broadening the type of student who can receive this type of  training, expanding diversity in forensic anthropology. These models are not  limited to forensic archeological fieldwork; they can also be applied to forensic  anthropology laboratory projects. Utilizing HIPs and employing a more equitable  contractor model contributes to student professionalization, strengthens  professional prospects beyond the university, and contributes to DEIB  initiatives, all of which benefit forensic anthropology as a subdiscipline.},

Analysis of that diversity provides insight  into long-standing questions in evolutionary and conservation biology and is  urgent given severe threats these species are facing. Here, we present  high-coverage whole-genome data from 233 primate species representing 86\% of  genera and all 16 families. This dataset was used, together with fossil  calibration, to create a nuclear DNA phylogeny and to reassess evolutionary  divergence times among primate clades. We found within-species genetic diversity  across families and geographic regions to be associated with climate and  sociality, but not with extinction risk. Furthermore, mutation rates differ  across species, potentially influenced by effective population sizes. Lastly, we  identified extensive recurrence of missense mutations previously thought to be  human specific. This study will open a wide range of research avenues for future  primate genomic research.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

The objective of this  paper is, therefore, to review and critically discuss existing studies that have  applied these advanced approaches in archaeology, with a specific focus on  digital preservation and object detection. RS standalone approaches including  range-based and image-based modelling (e.g., laser scanning and SfM  photogrammetry) have several disadvantages in terms of spatial resolution,  penetrations, textures, colours, and accuracy. These limitations have led some  archaeological studies to fuse/integrate multiple RS datasets to overcome  limitations and produce comparatively detailed outcomes. However, there are still  knowledge gaps in examining the effectiveness of these RS approaches in enhancing  the detection of archaeological remains/areas. Thus, this review paper is likely  to deliver valuable comprehension for archaeological studies to fill knowledge  gaps and further advance exploration of archaeological areas/features using RS  along with DL approaches.},

This paper describes the conception and development  of such a research database and illustrates how big data can be harnessed to  formulate new ideas about the past. The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of  Humans (ROCEEH) is a transdisciplinary research center whose aim is to study the  origins of culture and the multifaceted aspects of human expansions across Africa  and Eurasia over the last three million years. To support its research, the  ROCEEH team developed an online tool named the ROCEEH Out of Africa Database  (ROAD) and implemented its web-based applications. ROAD integrates geographical  data as well as archaeological, paleoanthropological, paleontological and  paleobotanical content within a robust chronological framework. In fact, a unique  feature of ROAD is its ability to dynamically link scientific data both spatially  and temporally, thereby allowing its reuse in ways that were not originally  conceived. The data stem from published sources spanning the last 150 years,  including those generated by the research team. Descriptions of these data rely  on the development of a standardized vocabulary and profit from online  explanations of each table and attribute. By synthesizing legacy data, ROAD  facilitates the reuse of heritage data in novel ways. Database queries yield  structured information in a variety of interoperable formats. By visualizing data  on maps, users can explore this vast dataset and develop their own theories. By  downloading data, users can conduct further quantitative analyses, for example  with Geographic Information Systems, modeling programs and artificial  intelligence. In this paper, we demonstrate the innovative nature of ROAD and  show how it helps scientists studying human evolution to access datasets from  different fields, thereby connecting the social and natural sciences. Because it  permits the reuse of "old" data in new ways, ROAD is now an indispensable tool  for researchers of human evolution and paleogeography.},

Consequently, they are categorized under the term “generative AI,” whether they are generating text, images, or other media. They work by modeling human language statistically, to “learn” patterns from extremely large datasets of human-created content, with those that specifically focus on text therefore called Large Language Models (LLMs).

Digital technology is an emerging tool that can be applied in recent works in this field, leading to an effective and efficient recording of building heritage and accompanied information. Hence, such technology can provide a deeper understanding, learning and justification of its behavior as well as utilization of these information throughout a maintenance process. The present study aims to formulate a new computational design workflow based on the 3D modeling of historic buildings, through the creation of an as-build model of a registered listed building. This is achieved through parametric clustering and schematic modeling based on computational methods for developing 3D surfaces and shapes that correspond to building parts. Challenges of 3D modeling originated in the complexity of form, such as the selected building part under investigation, are discussed. For the implementation of the research, the Holy Church of Agios Georgios Tropaiophoros in the village of Dali in the district of Nicosia (CY) is chosen as a case study. The results derived from the specific workflow are evaluated and then used for the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) platform, an emerging technology with great potential in perception and navigation of building heritage.},

            This paper illustrates the results obtained by using pre-trained semantic segmentation deep learning models for the detection of archaeological sites within the Mesopotamian floodplains environment. The models were fine-tuned using openly available satellite imagery and vector shapes coming from a large corpus of annotations (i.e., surveyed sites). A randomized test showed that the best model reaches a detection accuracy in the neighborhood of 80\%. Integrating domain expertise was crucial to define how to build the dataset and how to evaluate the predictions, since defining if a proposed mask counts as a prediction is very subjective. Furthermore, even an inaccurate prediction can be useful when put into context and interpreted by a trained archaeologist. Coming from these considerations we close the paper with a vision for a Human–AI collaboration workflow. Starting with an annotated dataset that is refined by the human expert we obtain a model whose predictions can either be combined to create a heatmap, to be overlaid on satellite and/or aerial imagery, or alternatively can be vectorized to make further analysis in a GIS software easier and automatic. In turn, the archaeologists can analyze the predictions, organize their onsite surveys, and refine the dataset with new, corrected, annotations.},

Employing high-resolution scanning combined with  morphometric measurements for morphological analysis, we aimed to understand the  effects of charring on grape pips. Our morphometric analysis demonstrated  significant alterations in seed shape above 250 °C. The length-width ratio and  the occurrence of cracks notably changed, providing a basis for assessing  charring conditions. In addition, applying a machine learning classification  method, we determined that accurate classification of grape varieties by the  morphometric analysis method is feasible for seeds charred at up to 250 °C and  8 h. Integrating the morphometric changes and temperature ranges suitable for  classification, we developed a sorting model for archaeological seeds. By  projecting length-width ratios onto a curve calculated from controlled  conditions, we estimated charring temperatures. Approximately 50\% of  archaeological seeds deviated from the model, indicating drastic charring  conditions. This sorting model facilitates a stringent selection of seeds fit for  classification, enhancing the accuracy of our machine learning-based methodology.  In conclusion, combining machine learning with morphometric sorting enables the  identification of charred grape seeds suitable for identification by the  morphometric method. This comprehensive approach provides a valuable tool for  future research for the identification of charred grape seeds found in  archaeological contexts, enhancing our understanding of ancient viticulture  practices and grape cultivation.},

The methodological approach proposed in this paper has been  implemented according to a multimodal mapping technique involving the  simultaneous and integrated use of both optical and geoacoustic sensors. This  approach has been enriched by tools based on artificial intelligence (AI),  specifically intended to be installed onboard the ARGO-USV, aimed at the  automatic recognition of submerged targets and the physical characterization of  the seabed.

The  transmission of all acquired data in broadcasting allows the cooperation of a  multidisciplinary team of specialists able to analyze specific datasets in real  time.

This leads  to a "landscape" of possibilities that our species has explored over millennia of  cultural evolution. However, what does this fitness landscape, which constrains  and guides cultural evolution, look like? The machine-learning algorithms that  can answer these questions are typically developed for large-scale datasets.  Applications to the sparse, inconsistent, and incomplete data found in the  historical record have received less attention, and standard recommendations can  lead to bias against marginalized, under-studied, or minority cultures. We show  how to adapt the minimum probability flow algorithm and the Inverse Ising model,  a physics-inspired workhorse of machine learning, to the challenge. A series of  natural extensions-including dynamical estimation of missing data, and  cross-validation with regularization-enables reliable reconstruction of the  underlying constraints. We demonstrate our methods on a curated subset of the  Database of Religious History: records from 407 religious groups throughout human  history, ranging from the Bronze Age to the present day. This reveals a complex,  rugged, landscape, with both sharp, well-defined peaks where state-endorsed  religions tend to concentrate, and diffuse cultural floodplains where evangelical  religions, non-state spiritual practices, and mystery religions can be found.},

We  tested a range of competing demographic scenarios using a coalescent-based  machine learning Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework that we  modified for use with phenotypic data. Mostly in agreement with but also  challenging some of the hitherto available evidence, we identified a population  turnover in western Europe at {\textasciitilde}28 ka, isolates in western and eastern refugia  between {\textasciitilde}28 and 14.7 ka, and bottlenecks during the Last Glacial Maximum.

These products rely on  recent vegetation trends and hindcasted statistical data. Desertification which  occurred prior to the later twentieth century is poorly represented, if at all.

We present a new and open-source  machine-learning workflow for detecting desertification using satellite data.

The input  datasets comprised training polygons, a 12-band Sentinel-2 composite and derived  tasselled cap components, and a Sentinel-1 VV-polarisation composite. We test our  approach for a case study of Skoura oasis in southern Morocco with a resulting  accuracy of 74-76\% for the desertification class.

Following death, bones undergo a series of chemical and  physical transformations due to their interactions with the surrounding  environment. Post-mortem changes have been assessed using various methods, but  estimating the PMI of skeletal remains could still be improved. We propose a new  methodology with handheld hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system based on the first  results from 104 human skeletal remains with PMIs ranging between 1 day and 2000  years. To differentiate between forensic and archaeological bone material, the  Convolutional Neural Network analyzed 65.000 distinct diagnostic spectra: the  classification accuracy was 0.58, 0.62, 0.73, 0.81, and 0.98 for PMIs of 0 week-2  weeks, 2 weeks-6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1 year-10 years, and {\textgreater}100 years,  respectively. In conclusion, HSI can be used in forensic medicine to distinguish  bone materials {\textgreater}100 years old from those {\textless}10 years old with an accuracy of 98\%.  The model has adequate predictive performance, and handheld HSI could serve as a  novel approach to objectively and accurately determine the PMI of human skeletal  remains.},

Since 640 CE, many of these ancient terraces have remained untouched but buried  by sediments, covered by natural vegetation, and partially destroyed. The main  goal of the current research is to develop a procedure for the automatic  recognition of ancient water harvesting systems by incorporating two remote  sensing datasets (a high-resolution color orthophoto and LiDAR-derived  topographic variables) and two advanced processing methods (an object-based image  analysis (OBIA) and a deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) model). A  confusion matrix of object-based classification revealed an overall accuracy of  86\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79. The DCNN model achieved a Mean Intersection  over Union (MIoU) value for testing datasets of 53. The individual IoU values of  terraces and sidewalls were 33.2 and 30.1, respectively. The current study  demonstrates how incorporating OBIA, aerial photographs, and LiDAR in the context  of DCNN improves the identification and mapping of archaeological structures.},

Across the  southern rim of Amazonia, over 1,000 earthwork sites comprised of fortified  settlements, mound villages, and ditched enclosures with geometric designs known  as geoglyphs have been discovered. Qualitatively distinct and densely located  along the lower stretches of major river systems and the Atlantic coast are  Amazonian Dark Earth sites (ADEs) with deep anthropogenic soils enriched by  long-term human habitation. Models predicting the geographic extents of  earthworks and ADEs can assist in their discovery and preservation and help  answer questions about the full degree of indigenous landscape modifications  across Amazonia. We classify earthworks versus ADEs versus other  non-earthwork/non-ADE archaeological sites with multi-class machine learning  algorithms using soils, climate, and distances to rivers of different types and  sizes as geospatial predictors. Model testing is done with spatial  cross-validation, and the best model at the optimal spatial scale of 1 km has an  Area Under the Curve of 0.91. Our predictive model has led to the discovery of 13  new geoglyphs, and it pinpoints specific areas with high probabilities of  undiscovered archaeological sites that are currently hidden by rainforests. The  limited, albeit impressive, predicted extents of earthworks and ADEs means that  other non-ADE/non-earthwork sites are expected to predominate most of Western and  Northern Amazonia.},

	abstract = {Understanding how resource characteristics influence variability in social and material inequality among foraging populations is a prominent area of research.  However, obtaining cross-comparative data from which to evaluate theoretically  informed resource characteristic factors has proved difficult, particularly for  investigating interactions of characteristics. Therefore, we develop an  agent-based model to evaluate how five key characteristics of primary resources  (predictability, heterogeneity, abundance, economy of scale and monopolizability)  structure pay-offs and explore how they interact to favour both egalitarianism  and inequality. Using iterated simulations from 243 unique combinations of  resource characteristics analysed with an ensemble machine-learning approach, we  find the predictability and heterogeneity of key resources have the greatest  influence on selection for egalitarian and nonegalitarian outcomes. These results  help explain the prevalence of egalitarianism among foraging populations, as many  groups probably relied on resources that were both relatively less predictable  and more homogeneously distributed. The results also help explain rare forager  inequality, as comparison with ethnographic and archaeological examples suggests  the instances of inequality track strongly with reliance on resources that were  predictable and heterogeneously distributed. Future work quantifying comparable  measures of these two variables, in particular, may be able to identify  additional instances of forager inequality.

	abstract = {This contribution examines the palaeontological and geological aspects found in abbot Fortis's letter to Cavalier Giuseppe Cobres, focusing on fossil elephant remains discovered in the Serbaro di Romagnano locality (Grezzana, Verona). While the letter addresses these specific findings, it also delves into broader discussions encompassing key topics in Earth Sciences. Abbot Fortis accurately attributes the large bones to ancient elephant skeletons, dismissing interpretations linking them to 'mythological creatures' or 'ancient giants'. However, questions surrounding the presence of these fossils remain unresolved, including, for example, the discovery of remains of animals at the time considered as typical of warm climates in areas that are now very cold such as present-day Siberia. Fortis highlights the sedimentary features of Romagnano, indicating an extensive formation period spanning countless centuries, challenging Buffon's proposed Epochs. The gradual accumulation of marine organism remains and river-carried sediments forming seabed deposits, leads Fortis to strengthen the central concept of "deep time", which would be necessary in the following century to the birth of modern Geology. Drawing on his previous work, Fortis employs the Romagnano description to counter theoretical models and geological systems. He uses the large valleys and small river incisions to critique Bourguet's "salienti ed entranti" theory, which attributes large incisions to ancient sea currents. Fortis also opposes diluvialist theories that explain valley systems as the withdrawal of the Deluge water. The author evaluates various theories regarding the elephant remains, refuting them albeit suggesting an even more imaginative and naive hypothesis. Despite Fortis's extravagant interpretation, his work introduces geological arguments and principles that later become pivotal in Earth Sciences. He delves into the biology and ecology of elephants, discussing their potential presence in European territories. He also anticipates taphonomic analysis concepts, considering biostratinomic and diagenetic processes that affected bone preservation. The author acknowledges the importance of studying fossil remains in their original context for understanding taphonomy. In conclusion, abbot Fortis's letter offers significant insights into early Earth Sciences, tackling palaeontological, geological, and taphonomic aspects. His discussions and observations foreshadowed essential concepts that would later shape the field, demonstrating the forward-thinking perspectives of eighteenth-century Italian naturalists.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the feasibility of using the internal standard (IS) method and optimized regression model (ORM) to determine lead isotope ratios without separating Pb from many different types of matrices. The effect of typical interferents at increasing concentrations was investigated using model samples. We have demonstrated that Pb isotope ratio measurements without matrix separation give equally accurate and precise results as those obtained with matrix separation. Finally we used a new protocol to measure the isotope ratio of Pb in environmental, geological and archaeological samples with very limited availability (3 mg) and low lead content (30 mg kg-1). Such samples have so far been problematic for MC-ICP-MS isotopic analysis due to the difficulties with separating such small amounts of lead using ion exchange resins. Lead isotope ratios were measured without separation of lead from the sample using two protocols. In the first, the internal standard method was used as a means of calibration. In the second, the optimized regression model was used. In this case there were no statistically significant differences between the protocols compared. Both approaches gave statistically similar results. The protocol using IS is recommended as it is significantly simpler and less laborious and consumes lower volumes of sample solution. The protocol we developed can be applied to a wide range of samples (following some recommendations). To demonstrate the usefulness of the new procedure, we applied it to different types of samples containing lead at different concentrations. In particular, we focused on historical samples because their availability is very limited and collecting a sufficiently large sample is always a major problem. Where possible, we compared our results with literature values. The new protocol, by eliminating the sample preparation step, allowed us to measure about four times more samples per day (about 12-15) compared to the classical method (with Pb separation using ion exchange resins). We also present, for the first time, a new method for the non-destructive sampling of manuscripts for isotopic analysis, involving the extraction of lead from the object into indicator papers soaked in 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline.
Pb isotope ratios in samples of diverse origin can be accurately measured without matrix separation.},

Methods: The individual has been sexed using traditional anthropological methods and ancient DNA. C14 dating has also been obtained. The lesion has been analysed macroscopically and microscopically using SEM. Results: The skull under study belonged to an adult female deposited in the second burial phase (2566-2239 years cal BCE). It exhibits in the anterior region of the right temporal fossa two contiguous and partially overlapping holes that correspond to two trepanations performed using the scraping technique.Conclusions: It is a double cranial trepanation with signs of bone remodelling suggesting survival from surgery. No pathological signs were identified potentially associated with the intervention.Significance: This is the second case of surgical interventions in the geographical area of study and one of the few evidences of this practice in women during prehistoric times.Limitations: So far only the articulated skeletons from this burial have been thoroughly analysed. Suggestions for further research: Further intensive review of skull collection is advised to learn more about these surgical interventions in Copper Age and to go deeper into the causes that motivated their execution.},

The dimensions of "extension" and "recurrence" at geographic and technological levels affect the complexity of their knowledge process; they require systematic ways for their categorisation and comprehension to guarantee correct diagnosis and suitable rehabilitation. Recent applications involving Internet of Things (IoT) for the built Cultural Heritage have demonstrated the potentialities of three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) models and structured databases in supporting complex degrees of knowledge for technicians, as well as management for administrators. Starting from such experiences, the work presents the setting up of a web-based platform to support the knowledge and management of systemic architectures, considering the geographical distribution of fabrics, natural and anthropic boundary conditions, and technical and administrative details. The platform takes advantage of digital models, machine and deep learning procedures and relational databases, in a GIS-based environment, for the recognition and categorisation of prevalent physical and qualitative features of systemic architectures, the recognition and qualification of dominant and recurrent decays and the management of recovery activities in a semi-automatic way. Specifically, the main digital objects used for testing the applied techniques and setting up the platform are based on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and mapped point clouds of the historical Telegraphic Towers located along the Madrid-Valencia path, resulting from the on-site investigations. Their choice is motivated by the high level of knowledge about the cases reached in the last years by the authors, allowing them to test rules within the decision support systems and innovative techniques for their decay mapping. As the experience has demonstrated, the systematisation of technical details and operative pipeline of methods and tools allow the normalisation and standardisation of the intervention selection process; this offers policymakers an innovative tool based on traditional procedures for conservation plans, coherent with a priority-based practice.},

We propose PM-Vis, a visual analytics system for tracing and analyzing the evolution of pottery motifs. PM-Vis is anchored in a "selection-organization-documentation" workflow. In the selection stage, we design a three-fold projection paired with a motif-based search mechanism, displaying the appearance similarity and temporal and spatial proximities of all motifs or a specific motif, aiding users in selecting motifs with evolutionary connections. The organization stage helps users establish the evolutionary sequence and segment the selected motifs into distinct evolutionary phases. Finally, the documentation stage enables users to record their observations and insights through various forms of annotation. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of PM-Vis through two case studies, expert feedback, and a user study.},

	abstract = {The field of 3D craniofacial similarity calculation and craniofacial relationships(the relationships between the human skull and face) analysis is a challenging and meaningful task in archaeology, forensic science, and anthropology. Although anthropologists have been involved in the application and illustration of craniofacial relationships in their research, due to the complexity of the 3D skull (with multiple holes), and the facial expression changes of 3D human faces, it is difficult to accurately perform 3D craniofacial similarity calculations and theoretical validation of craniofacial relationships are difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that constructs a shape feature space based on spectral analysis to describe the intrinsic structure of 3D skulls and faces. Our framework includes a shape analysis method to measure 3D craniofacial similarity and a statistical method using canonical correlation analysis to comprehensively describe the craniofacial relationships from global statistical features and individual geometric features. Based on an Asian craniofacial database, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through validation results and skull identification. Most importantly, we provide two craniofacial relationships rules through theoretical validation and numerical results: R1-the human skull has a strong correlation with the face; R2-the similarity change trend of the skull is generally consistent with the corresponding face similarity. These craniofacial relationships rules can be applied to general craniofacial analysis tasks and scenarios, providing a solid theoretical basis for relevant researchers. Our research represents a significant contribution to the field of 3D craniofacial similarity calculation and craniofacial relationships analysis.},

In addition, the applied algorithm allows real-time detection and the identification of seasonal sources of disruption, which is proved by the video test in this study.

	abstract = {Heritage multimedia, which comprises images, audio, and videos, are precious artifacts of a region. In addition to enabling a better understanding of earlier generations, heritage media provides information about their creative approach, style of living, and diversity of historical and archaeological ideologies. Heritage is an important resource that boosts the local economy, generates sustainable communities, and improves tourism and business sectors. Once heritage images are dissipated to consumers, they may be transmitted through wire/wireless systems, where the data may be accessed by both authorized and unauthorized consumers. With the rapid advancement of technology and 5G networks, establishing an approach that protects cultural heritage media from unauthorized consumers is necessary. This study presents a robust and blind watermarking-framework for cultural images (RBWCI) utilizing the discrete cosine transform domain for ownership verification and copyright protection. The embedding scenario of our technique relies on the difference between coefficients obtained from the two channels of the YCbCr color model. The watermark bit is embedded by taking the difference between two preselected mid-frequency coefficients (Cb-Cr). Moreover, chaotic and deoxyribonucleic acid encryption are employed to ensure double-layer watermark security. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a peak signal-to-noise ratio between 42-43 dB and structural similarity index metric value of approximately 1 for different test images when not under attack. The robustness of the RBWCI was revealed by comparing it with various state-of-the-art schemes, making it suitable for different consumer applications.},

	abstract = {Siliceous sandstone (including quartzites), petrified wood, and agates located in Alabama and Mississippi were utilized as a toolstone resource during every recognized cultural period in the Lower Mississippi Valley region of the Southeastern United States. Regrettably, these materials have not been the focus of many provenance-related investigations. Recent analyses of quartzite and sandstone from other regions in North America and from the Pyrenees were successful in discriminating sources using petrographic techniques. The current study examines the application of visible/near-infrared reflectance and Fourier transform infrared reflectance (FTIR) spectroscopy on sourcing siliceous materials besides chert, particularly sandstones, orthoquartzites (quartz sandstone), petrified woods, and agates. This source characterization investigation focuses on a case study involving materials gathered from eight distinct collection sites, encompassing nine different siliceous resources collected in Alabama and Mississippi. These materials were sourced from two distinct geological formations: the Hattiesburg and Tallahatta. Results demonstrate the ability of non-destructive reflectance spectroscopy and introduces a new outlier modeling method that detects, clusters, and separately models outliers with their own set of basis vectors. Principal component analyses, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, linear discriminant function analysis (LDA), and random forest classification are used in this paper to better identify outlier elements as well as discriminate for stone materials accurately (between 67\% and 100\%). Although this is the first reflectance spectroscopy investigation used to characterize these materials for provenance applications, the preliminary results compare favorably with other provenance techniques whose aim is to quantify between-formation (inter) and within-formation (intra) outcrop variation. The quantified and differentiated sources, based on the hyperspectral signatures of the material, will provide a better understanding of prehistoric reliance on these lithic resources and produces a proxy to determine mobility, social interaction, and other past behavior.},

In this context, it is essential to investigate the position of the Ka`ba in the pre -Islamic period, its place in the Arab society and the symbolic meanings of the figures and paintings in its sacred area. When the Ka`ba is examined in the light of the data in the narrations, the idols of people from 360 different tribes and religions in the haram area (sacred boundary area), the statue of Hubal, who has common features with the deity Baal and is considered one of the most important gods of Mecca, the figures of prophet Abraham, who is depicted drawing the fortune arrows of Hubal, and the relatively small statue of Ishmael, the ancestor of the Arabs, standing next to him, a pair of horns believed to belong to the ram that Abraham sacrificed in place of Ishmael, and depictions of many prophets, including Mary and Jesus, trees and angels. It is known through narrations that the Ka`ba remained in this state until the conquest of Mecca by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. However, information on the dates when these images and figures began to be placed is controversial. The lack of written sources about the pre -Islamic period in Arabia and the lack of archaeological data due to geographical conditions are generally the main problems of Qur'\& amacr;nic history studies. For this reason, the interpretations to be made on the limited amount of information obtained should be evaluated in terms of providing ideas for future studies . The fact that the information about the Ka`ba from the preIslamic period has disappeared has made it necessary for us to investigate the subject mostly within the framework of narrations. Since we do not have visuals of the materials inside the Ka`ba, in -text visuals were created with artificial intelligence (AI) based on the descriptive and illustrative expressions in the narrations to give the reader an idea and help him visualize the environment.},

Currently, phytolith identification and categorisation involves time-consuming and tedious manual classification tasks that are not always error free. Automated phytolith classification will be key to the standardisation of phytolith identification processes, circumventing human error in the phytolith identification process. In this paper, a comparative analysis is presented of different types of feature sets, feature combinations, and classifier combinations (through stacking), and their use for automatic phytolith classification, including state-of-the-art vision transformers and convolutional neural networks, techniques which have shown remarkable progress within different areas, including computer vision. In this research, twenty-two different sets of features (three based on shape, sixteen on appearance, and three on texture) and six classifier strategies (single and combined via stacking) were compared. The experimental results revealed that texture-related features offered no valuable information for classification purposes. However, classification tasks were efficiently performed with strategies based on shape and appearance features (extracted using deep neural networks). More specifically, the use of those features combined with a stacking strategy, achieved better results than any other features and feature-based strategies, with an accuracy value of 98.32\%.},

In 1966 Elizabeth French published a paper discussing the pottery, assigning it an early Late Helladic IIIB1 date. From these accounts, we know that the deposit appeared in four trenches: Prehistoric Cemetery Central (PCC) III, where it sat on a surface of hard tramped earth; PCC IV, where it lay on bedrock; and PCC III Extension East and Area VII, where it rested on white clay plaster floors. But otherwise we learn little about the stratigraphy of these four trenches. Using Hood's unpublished excavation notebook, this paper examines the stratigraphy of the trenches associated with the deposit and uncovers the archaeological history of the area. In doing so, it reveals several omissions in the published accounts, most notably that there was another surface immediately below the white clay plaster floor in PCC III Extension East and a deposit of pottery associated with it. The pottery from this layer, designated Level 3, was mistakenly included by French in her paper. Fifty-four decorated sherds from Level 3 were kept, seven of which were illustrated by French. Most of the sherds come from small stirrup jars; kylikes, including the Zygouries type; Group A deep bowls; and stemmed bowls. The five most popular motifs on the sherds are the flower, whorl-shell, wavy line, parallel chevrons and panelled patterns. The shapes and motifs reflect those in the main pottery deposit and indicate a date of early Late Helladic IIIB1 for the group. The conclusion emphasises the importance of using excavation notebooks in research.},

We reviewed representative global and regional historical land use reconstructions for South Asia from their data sources, methods of area estimation and spatial mapping, and outcomes. Then we made some prospects on developing historical land use for South Asia. The land use area of South Asia in global reconstructions was mainly estimated using population. For the spatial pattern, most of them assumed that the historical distribution of land use in South Asia mimics satellite-based land use patterns or that the land use area was pixelized based on land suitability for cultivation and grazing. Large discrepancies exist among these global reconstructions in the land use area and spatial patterns with increasing magnitude with time in the past. The regional reconstructions of historical land use for South Asia used more regional historical records, but most covered only about one hundred years. The closer to the past, the lower the spatial-temporal resolution of these regional reconstructions. Great discrepancies also exist between these regional re-constructions because of the differences in cropland definition. Expansion of archaeological data sources, meta-analysis, and crowdsourcing will bring insights into area estimation of historical land use. Remote sensing and machine learning will facilitate spatial pattern mapping. Reconstruction region-by-region, and then integration, is also a solution for current challenges in reconstructing historical land use for South Asia.},

The analysis was conducted on the basis of statistical data of different governmental organizations that monitor the condition of counteracting the criminal business in this sphere, as well as the expert assessments of leading Russian companies and specialists who study the situation with illicit trade in cultural property. As this criminal business is of transnational character, foreign sources, both statistical and analytical, were used for a comparative analysis. In addition to the analysis of criminal business, which is immediately connected with the trade in cultural property, the author also assessed the situation in the related criminal market of art forgeries. As a results, the author concludes that illicit trade in cultural property both in Russia and in the world is, on average, about 10 \% of the legal trade. Statistical indicators determining the ranges of registered crimes that regulate criminal liability for activities in this sphere demonstrate a decrease in the number of thefts of objects of cultural value, and, simultaneously, an increase in illegal search and appropriation of archeological artifacts from their resting places. At the same time, trafficking of cultural property is decreasing, and only isolated cases of such crimes are registered. The analysis of the features of stolen objects showed that their Russian and global structures differ: while numismatic property and other small objects are the dominant type of goods in the world, Russian trafficking is dominated by icons (60 \%). The market of forgeries of cultural property is growing, it is closely connected with the legal market of original cultural property and the market of corrupt service. The key factors determining the development of this segment of criminal market are the following: an increasing demand for objects of cultural value; the appearance of special places for their storage (freeports) with an offshore status; transnational character of criminal activities; use of telecommunication networks for finding and trading goods without identifying the participants of such trade. Counteraction is quite effective due to its well-developed mechanism of legal regulation, as well as the formation of international databases of stolen objects of cultural value, which hinders their legalization, and the use of these data for the creation of digital clones of such objects with the involvement of artificial intelligence in their identification.},

This tool aims to evaluate the functional operational age and life cycle of heritage buildings in the Arc de Bera area in Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, with the goal of promoting preventive conservation through a multidisciplinary approach. The tool considers various factors that contribute to the condition of heritage buildings, including structural stability, material decay, environmental risks, and usage patterns. By employing a fuzzy model, it provides an assessment of the building's condition in historical sites. One of the key features of the Art-Risk tool is its ability to prioritize intervention among different case studies within a specific urban context. It generates three output results: vulnerability, risk, and functionality index. The vulnerability value indicates the level of vulnerability of a building, with lower values suggesting better structural stability and resilience against potential hazards. The risk value signifies the level of risk associated with a building, with lower values indicating a reduced likelihood of damage or deterioration. The functionality index reflects the operational condition and suitability of a building for its intended use, with higher values indicating better functionality and operational performance, by considering these diverse valuations, stakeholders and conservation plan managers can effectively establish priorities for intervention. Buildings with higher vulnerability, risk, or lower functionality index scores are given higher priority for intervention. This approach ensures that limited resources are allocated to the buildings that require immediate attention, maximizing the impact of conservation efforts. Art-Risk 3.0 model incorporates 19 input variables, with five variables automatically assigned based on the building's geographic location. Users are required to provide valid geographical coordinates and the remaining 14 associated values to obtain an accurate assessment of the building's condition.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the Araucaria Forest in southern Brazil underwent expansions in the past, driven either by human groups or by climate fluctuations of the Holocene and Pleistocene. Fossil pollen records of the Parana pine Araucaria angustifolia, a dominant tree in that forest, provide some insights into when those may have occurred. Still, the timing of those expansions has never been estimated. To infer past range shifts and shed light on their main drivers, we employed next-generation DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), machine learning, and a comprehensive database of fossil pollen records into a study of historical demographic inference and paleo-distribution modeling of the Parana pine. We found that A. angustifolia comprises two populations expanding at different times: one in the Mantiqueira mountain chain, the other in the southern Brazilian plateau. The southern population began to expand during the Last Glacial Period similar to 70 kya, long before human arrival in South America. Still, genetic analyses support that humans later impacted this population, resulting in lower genetic diversity, higher inbreeding, and high levels of gene flow over large distances with a weak pattern of isolation-by-distance. It is possible this resulted from human influence on seed dispersal and germination on the southern Brazilian plateau. The Mantiqueira population, in contrast, expanded only recently (similar to 3 kya). This timing coincides with Holocene climatic changes and human settlements established further south, although, to date, there is little archeological evidence of human impact in the Mantiqueira. In addition, multitemporal species distribution models built from a combination of present-day and pollen records infer a range expansion of the Araucaria Forest during glacial times until the cold humid HS1 event (similar to 16 kya), when the forest was most widespread, with no evidence of glacial refugia. The combination of genomic and spatial analyses suggests that both human and climatic controls played a role in the dynamics of the Araucaria Forest.},

We argue that the recent proliferation of machine learning and vision technologies create new scopic regimes for heritage: storing and retrieving existing images from vast digital archives, and further imparting their own distortions upon this gaze. We introduce the term 'machinic gaze' to conceptualise the reconfiguration of heritage representation via artificial intelligence (AI) models. To explore how this gaze reframes heritage, we deploy an image-text-image pipeline that reads, interprets, and resynthesizes images of several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Employing two concepts from media studies-heteroscopia and anamorphosis-we describe the reoriented perspective that machine vision systems introduce. We propose that the machinic gaze highlights the artifice of the human gaze and its underlying assumptions and practices that combine to form established notions of heritage.},

	abstract = {Underwater images suffer from different types of degradation, where color degradation occurs in the spatial domain and edge degradation in the frequency domain. The high -quality underwater image enhancement represents a crucial milestone in advancing computer vision systems tailored for marine environments. This foundational endeavor encompasses a wide array of applications in computer vision tasks, including underwater inspection, underwater archaeology, and environmental monitoring. However, current convolutional neural network (CNN) -based pyramid frameworks primarily focus on capturing local features, often overlooking the significance of global semantic features that play a crucial role in understanding underwater scenes. Moreover, these frameworks handle spatial and frequency features independently, failing to enhance images by exploring correlation among domain -specific attributes for enabling information consistency. Besides, optimizing the model using a loss function with the same domain attributes from the ground truth may not lead to a better generalization ability. To solve these problems, we propose a new Convolution -Transformer Blend Pyramid Network (CTPN), which consists of a spatial branch and several frequency branches. The CTPN has four key components: a Swin transformer encoder, a CNN -Transformer aggregated encoder-decoder (CTED) and a blend pyramid framework. The Swin transformer encoder is employed to capture global semantic features, benefiting from its ability to extract long-range and global dependencies among features. The CTED fuses local features captured by CNN layers and global semantic features captured by the Swin transformer encoder in the spatial branch, with the help of the Cross -Model Fusion Module (CFM) and Skip -Aggregation Module (SAM). Subsequently, a blend pyramid framework is designed which not only progressively expands the transformed information of the previous domain branch to the current domain branch via the CTED-based refining operation, but also utilizes the proposed Domain Affinity Block (DAB) to explore the connection between domain attributes, ensuring information consistency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing underwater image enhancement methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

	abstract = {Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case-the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies.
In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from amodular domain ontology, whichmodelsmartial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that representsways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.},

	abstract = {The lengths of-and numbers of steps in-stone artifact production sequences are often used as proxies for the emergence of cultural complexity in our lineage. This line of reasoning has been applied to the heat treatment of silcrete rocks by past hominins, where both the lengths and numbers of steps involved are contested. To simplify, one position argues that silcrete heat treatment was an elaborate, multi-level procedure involving the prolonged and indirect exposure of these rocks to fire. Each stage of production (building a fire, burying rocks at a specific depth below the fire, maintaining prolonged insulated heat, managing gradual cooling, and making or shaping blanks) was potentially reliant on the stage that came before. Others argue that silcrete heat treatment was far simpler, involving fewer steps (direct exposure of blanks to embers and/or flames in an open-air burning context), and that this process was managed by hominins no differently to everyday fire-related activities. A more nuanced position draws on the variable fabric texture and structural response to heating of different silcretes to argue that no single approach to heating may be suitable for all types. Determining maximum temperature exposure and/or heating rate would potentially allow one to differentiate these processes as described and thus resolve the implications of heat treatment for cultural complexity. Here, we present the results of experiments wherein multiple specimens of two structurally different South African silcretes were systematically heated to a controlled set of temperatures ranging from 110 to 750 degrees C, and the infrared responses to each temperature change were quantified. Importantly, measurements were collected non-destructively on stone flakes, providing for the archaeological applicability of the results to the Middle Stone Age record of southern Africa. We then use a combination of multivariate statistics, differential equations, and decision trees to develop a framework for reconstructing the annealing temperatures of silcrete flakes, demonstrating that heating temperature range can be predicted at success rates of 79.5 to {\textgreater} 95\% in a large sample of N = 225 observations.},

Light field video (LFV), considered an intermediate transition scheme towards the metaverse, is conducive to sensing and reconstructing realistic scenes in the digital twins. However, the research on LFV systems still lacks comprehensive investigation, impeding their practical application. This paper addresses major technical challenges involved in LFV delivery through mobile networks, showing a trade-off between equipment cost, calibration effort, and workflow simplicity. It also considers the balance of communications and computations latency when maintaining reconstruction performance. Leveraging edge and cloud infrastructure, a novel Mobile Edge Assisted Multi-view Light-field-video System (MEAMLS) is proposed, integrating LFV collection, volumetric video construction, and an immersive viewing scheme. A custom-made LFV capture array is designed to capture real-world scenes, while employing a learning method-integrated edge server to facilitate adaptive LFV coding. Moreover, a fast sparse reconstruction algorithm is established, leveraging edge-cloud collaboration to minimize computation latency during volumetric video construction. Intelligent service for users is deployed on edge to enable viewport-driven virtual reality viewing. By providing an immersive visual experience, the proposed MEAMLS bridges the physical world and its digital twins. The system is prototyped on a realistic 5G network to empirically validate the performance under static and dynamic circumstances. Experimental results yield fundamental insights for designing mobile edge networks-assisted LFV system from the perspective of transmission resource, adaptability, and deployment.},

	abstract = {The taphonomic evaluation of zooarchaeological assemblages is paramount for compelling interpretations of past subsistence strategies, palaeoecological interactions and overall biasing of the anthropogenic bone deposition and modification by non-anthropogenic agents. A recent trend in this field, has focused on bone surface modifications (BSM) to successfully generate reference frameworks for critical evaluation of the interpretive potential of selected zooarchaeological samples by examining BSM patterns produced by known agents in experimental settings. These approaches compare anthropogenic and non-human generated patterns using different machine learning (ML) algorithms, classifying and assigning sets of traces to specific processes such as gnawing, scoring or intentional fracture. We propose a simplification in two key aspects to make this new arising area of ML assisted taphonomic interpretation more accessible for zooarchaeologists. First, we encourage a trace oriented multivariate data recording protocol for taphonomic analysis including the most commonly recorded BSM plus others such as shape modification, penetrative modification and element or tissue loss modifications thus expanding comparative potential. Second, we offer a ML approach based on Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) that discriminates each given observation by comparing to actualistic taphonomic patterns to determine the average percentage of non-anthropogenic modification within zooarchaeological samples. To illustrate the potential value of these proposals for taphonomical interpretation, we analyzed seven different Mid to Late Holocene assemblages containing avian and mammal remains from the coastal platform in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. We compared their alteration with a local sample of actualistic data recovered to characterize regional taphonomic patterns. A NBC was trained with a 75\% random selection of the total archaeological and actualistic samples. Afterwards we tested the remaining sample, achieving over 90\% accuracy in determining whether a random specimen from any sample corresponded to an actualistic or an archaeological context implying key differences in taphonomic trace patterns.},

This location was used as a disposal pit approximately between the 15th and 16th centuries. The fragments exhibit text discoloration, hindering automatic recognition and human readability. To reveal the faded text, the fragments have been digitalized, converted into a perceptually uniform color space and the contrast has been enhanced. The photometric characteristics of the input and enhanced images have been statistically characterized, and the contrast enhancement assessed by a state-of-the-art metric. The statistical analysis of the text colour coordinates was carried out to develop supervised and unsupervised image segmentation, isolating the text.

For shallow waters, among the underwater imaging challenges, caustics, i.e., the complex physical phenomena resulting from the projection of light rays being refracted by the wavy surface, is likely the most crucial one. Caustics is the main factor during underwater imaging campaigns that massively degrades image quality and affects severely any 2-D mosaicking or 3-D reconstruction of the seabed. In this article, we propose a novel method for correcting the radiometric effects of caustics on shallow underwater imagery. Contrary to the state-of-the-art, the developed method can handle the seabed and riverbed of any anaglyph, correcting the images using real pixel information, thus, improving image matching and 3-D reconstruction processes. In particular, the developed method employs deep learning architectures to classify image pixels to "noncaustics" and "caustics." Then, it exploits the 3-D geometry of the scene to achieve a pixelwise correction, by transferring appropriate color values between the overlapping underwater images. Moreover, to fill the current gap, we have collected, annotated, and structured a real-world caustic data set, namely, R-CAUSTIC, which is openly available. Overall, based on the experimental results and validation, the developed methodology is quite promising in both detecting caustics and reconstructing their intensity.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the applications of hyperspectral imaging in the protection and analysis of cultural relics have received widespread attention. However, due to the limitation of imaging sensors, the spatial resolution of existing hyperspectral images is low, which hinders the development of hyperspectral digitization of cultural relics. Hyperspectral (HS) and RGB image fusion technology can generate hyperspectral images with high spatial resolution, which has gradually become a research hotspot. Inspired by the astounding performance of deep learning in various hyperspectral image processing tasks, this paper proposes a hyperspectral image fusion method based on dual-resolution fusion feature mutual guidance network (DRFFMG). Firstly, two feature extraction networks for HS and RGB images with different resolution pairs are designed to increase the richness of extracted features and reduce the loss of original hyperspectral information. Then, the spatial and spectral features extracted from the above feature extraction networks are fused, and a fusion feature mutual guidance module is designed to promote the mutual learning of different spatial features through information transmission, effectively reducing spatial distortion. Finally, the desired high spatial resolution HS image is restored from the fused features through an image reconstruction network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRFFMG network can produce fusion images competitive with even better to state of the arts, and retain spectral information while improving spatial resolution.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.culher.2024.03.005},
	abstract = {Eye trackers are more and more often employed by scientists willing to learn more about how cultural heritage is perceived. However, designers very seldom make use of this technology, primarily perhaps due to its expensive and time-consuming nature. By choosing not to employ eye trackers they limit themselves to their own ideas and choices, at the same time forfeiting all the potential advantages of social consultations with non-professionals. One can easily imagine that their work and its effects would only benefit should a way be found to make eye-tracking tests more logistically and financially feasible or if another measure was established that would make it possible to learn the visual reactions of regular people. This paper focuses on perception of anastylosis. There are numerous types of damaged structures that get reassembled and multiple ways of doing that. While most doctrinal documents assert that the original object and the added elements should be easily distinguishable, the two solutions, most often chosen by designers is to make the cavity fillings differ in either texture or luminance from the original material. It is obvious that this results in a large range of solutions to choose from - from shallow indentations in the stone surface to deep ones, from stone just a shade brighter than the original to a distinct cream-white one. Since it is impossible to test all the possible variations using eye trackers, the authors of this paper tried a different approach. Eleven different virtual images were prepared of the same reassembled ionic column. They varied in the level of modifications applied to either the texture or the luminance of the cavity fillings. The entire set of eleven stimuli was then shown to a group of professionals in the field of architecture and/or conservation of monuments. They were asked to choose the best stimuli, that is those that facilitate the differentiation of the old and new parts of the structure by non-professionals. Thus, reduced set of three stimuli was then used in an eye-tracking tests involving over 100 participants. The eye-tracking data, combined with the results of previous research on the perception of anastylosis allowed the authors to formulate several conclusions. It turned out that the images selected by the professionals were far from those that would potentially stimulate and help non-professionals the most. However, the obtained information allowed formulating a few basic guidelines as to the use of differences in texture and luminance in anastylosis. It also made it possible to find a financially and logistically feasible alternative to the demanding eye-tracking tests when it comes to introducing social consultations into the designing process.

Due to the large amount of published work on X-ray fluorescence in the area of cultural heritage, traditional literature review has become impractical, inefficient, time-consuming, and potentially less reliable. Therefore, it is important to take stock of which topics have been core to such research and whether specific time trends can be identified within them. Using topic modeling, this review aims to reveal core topics and trends in research on XRF analysis of painted heritage objects by examining 982 articles collected from Web of Science. Within this dataset of articles, ten topics have been identified. The identified topics can be clustered in three main categories: the methods used, the objects studied, and the specific materials studied. In terms of trends in topic share since 2010, it is especially noteworthy to see that the share of articles focused on the identification and study of painting materials and techniques has more than doubled. Similarly, another impressive increase can be observed for articles centered on advanced imaging spectroscopic techniques, such as macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) and reflectance hyperspectral imaging, for the study of easel paintings. The share of attention within XRF literature given to imaging spectroscopic techniques tripled between 2010 and 2017, though stabilizing in the subsequent years. Conversely, the share of articles which specifically deal with the development and improvement of energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopic techniques (i.e., portable ED-XRF, confocal micro-XRF, micro-grazing exit XRF) for the elemental analysis (including elemental depth profiling) of painted heritage objects has declined sharply.},

	abstract = {The attempts to recreate the facial appearances of mummies fascinate forensic anthropologists, archeologists, and the general public. Traditional manual facial approximation is commonly used in forensic anthropology and archeology. However, due to the lack of confident anatomical knowledge, practitioners' subjective interpretation and imagination may potentially compromise the accuracy of approximation results. The aim of this study was to develop a computerized method to generate a probable face of a mummified skull (98QZIM139K) excavated from the Zaghunluq cemetery in Xinjiang, China. A multi-slice computed tomography scanner was used to obtain digital models of the skull and mummified facial soft tissues. Due to the insufficient evidence of actual soft tissues, the average facial soft tissue thickness depths (FSTDs) of modern humans were assigned to the exterior surface of the mummified skull to generate the facial profile. A facial statistical shape model was then used to improve the approximation by filling in missing regions and adding facial features. Additionally, two different probable faces of the same mummified skull were recreated by utilizing various FSTDs representing thin and obese status. The results show that the approximated face exhibits prominent supraorbital ridges, a high nose, and a prominent anterior edge of the mandible. This is the first case study of generating the facial appearance of a mummified skull in the Zaghunluq cemetery, which aids anthropologists and archeologists in examining the morphological differences between the mummy and modern human faces and quantifying the extent of soft tissue mummification.},

Automated analysis methods, which have been rising in popularity and efficiency, allow for systematic evaluations of vast landscapes. Here, we use a Mask R-CNN deep learning model to evaluate terracing-artificially flattened areas surrounded by steeper slopes-on islands in American Samoa. Mask R-CNN is notable for its ability to simultaneously perform detection and segmentation tasks related to object recognition, thereby providing robust datasets of both geographic locations of terracing features and their spatial morphometry. Using training datasets from across American Samoa, we train this model to recognize terracing features and then apply it to the island of Tutuila to undertake an island-wide survey for terrace locations, distributions and morphologies. We demonstrate that this model is effective (F1 = 0.718), but limitations are also documented that relate to the quality of the lidar data and the size of terracing features. Our data show that the islands of American Samoa display shared patterns of terracing, but the nature of these patterns are distinct on Tutuila compared with the Manu'a island group. These patterns speak to the different interior configurations of the islands. This study demonstrates how deep learning provides a better understanding of landscape construction and behavioural patterning on Tutuila and has the capacity to expand our understanding of these processes on other islands beyond our case study.},

	abstract = {The ages of solar-like stars have been at the center of many studies such as exoplanet characterization or Galactic-archeology. While ages are usually computed from stellar evolution models, relations linking ages to other stellar properties, such as rotation and magnetic activity, have been investigated. With the large catalog of 55,232 rotation periods, P (rot), and photometric magnetic activity index, S (ph) from Kepler data, we have the opportunity to look for such magneto-gyro-chronology relations. Stellar ages are obtained with two stellar evolution codes that include treatment of angular momentum evolution, hence using P (rot) as input in addition to classical atmospheric parameters. We explore two different ways of predicting stellar ages on three subsamples with spectroscopic observations: solar analogs, late-F and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs. We first perform a Bayesian analysis to derive relations between S (ph) and ages between 1 and 5 Gyr, and other stellar properties. For late-F and G dwarfs, and K dwarfs, the multivariate regression favors the model with P (rot) and S (ph) with median differences of 0.1\% and 0.2\%, respectively. We also apply Machine Learning techniques with a Random Forest algorithm to predict ages up to 14 Gyr with the same set of input parameters. For late-F, G and K dwarfs together, predicted ages are on average within 5.3\% of the model ages and improve to 3.1\% when including P (rot). These are very promising results for a quick age estimation for solar-like stars with photometric observations, especially with current and future space missions.},

Historical databases and archaeology help reconstructing the service sector in ancient societies. Here, the purpose of this paper is to analyse occupational specialization within services in cities of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, as well as how the service sector is reflected in architectural remains, to identify differences and similarities with today's Europe. Design/methodology/approachOccupational titles are traced in epigraphical and literary sources, sorted according to ISCO-08. Secondary sources are used for the architectural evidence of service activities, as well as for the role of contests and entertainment in antiquity. FindingsCompared to current European service employment, professionals were fewer in classical Athens and imperial Rome, which had a greater proportion of specialized salespersons. There were few office buildings and no civic hospitals, but heavy investment in facilities for entertainment and well-being. Quality assessments for goods were little developed; contests for cultural and sports activities assessed entertainment service quality. Research limitations/implicationsThis study covers two periods in classical antiquity and is restricted to Mediterranean cultures, although findings may help understanding the service sector in poor countries with informal employment. Originality/valueWhile particular services provided in ancient cities have been studied, there has been no broad comparative overview of their service occupations.

Twenty designated corridors explore the geo-biological and cultural heritage of different regions of Africa over various periods, from deep time to the Anthropocene. Each corridor reveals a specific lens through which to investigate some of the rich scientific narratives embedded within it. The concept also facilitates learning and knowledge exchange across numerous disciplines: archeology, geology, geophysics, oceanography, glaciology, biology, botany, ecology, agriculture, engineering, spatial statistics, social sciences, and the humanities. This contribution analyses ten selected corridors in southern and western Africa, the Congo Basin, East Africa, and Madagascar. The various research themes explored include Earth impact hazard, origins of humankind, Snowball Earth, coastal food systems and conservation, the biogeography of lemurs, human settlement dynamics in Cameroon, tectonically linked earthquake occurrences in Algeria and Morocco, modelling land-use changes in the Western Rift Valley, trades and civilizations of the Mali Empire, Mbira music, and contemporary art. The ongoing work on these-and ten other-corridors has considerable potential to host new international collaborations to develop the links between society and natural sciences in Africa. Ultimately, AAC will benefit all stakeholders, especially the youth, in understanding and responding to societal needs and current global challenges.},

Existing methods depend on strong assumptions on the number of shape pieces and coherent geometry or semantics of shape pieces. Despite raising attention to 3D registration with complex or low overlapping patterns, few methods consider shape assembly with rare overlaps. To address this problem, we present a novel framework inspired by solving puzzles, named PuzzleNet, which conducts multi-task learning by leveraging both 3D alignment and boundary information. Specifically, we design an end-to-end neural network based on a point cloud transformer with two-way branches for estimating rigid transformation and predicting boundaries simultaneously. The framework is then naturally extended to reassemble multiple pieces into a full shape by using an iterative greedy approach based on the distance between each pair of candidate-matched pieces. To train and evaluate PuzzleNet, we construct two datasets, named DublinPuzzle and ModelPuzzle, based on a real-world urban scan dataset (DublinCity) and a synthetic CAD dataset (ModelNet40) respectively. Experiments demonstrate our effectiveness in solving 3D shape assembly for multiple pieces with arbitrary geometry and inconsistent semantics. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by more than 10 times in rotation metrics and four times in translation metrics.},

These ancient Chinese characters are hieroglyph with special spatial structure and gradually evolving into modern Chinese characters. However, because of the intrinsic limitations of traditional convolutional networks in the model, the geometric structure of the convolutional module is fixed. Therefore, we build a new architecture called attention-based deformable networks for this task. Besides, we construct a new dataset called the Chinese characters from Various Dynasties Dataset (CCDD), which includes the evolution of Chinese characters between major dynasties. Deformable convolution based on attention mechanism can obtain those more important offsets, resulting in better performance than the original deformable convolution. In the experimental stage, extensive experiments validate the performance of our approach. Firstly, the effectiveness of this network was verified on two text datasets, Mnist(99.38\%) and notMnist(98.22\%) both comparing with several modules. Finally, the best performance was achieved on the CCDD dataset(91.50\%) compared to other classical deep learning networks. This is the first paper to apply deep learning methods to recognize and classify the characters of major dynasties in China. And archaeological workers need to be able to recognize Chinese characters from various periods in China, and our algorithm can assist them in completing this task to a certain extent. It can also help cultural relic enthusiasts roughly determine the age of cultural relics.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has significant potential in Earth sciences, particularly in mineral identification for industrial exploration, geological mapping, and archaeological research. However, traditional methods are time-consuming, expensive, and complex. And existing mineral identification methods based on mineral photos face several critical challenges, including lack of consideration for natural image features captured in real environments, limitations of single-label classification which does not align with multi mineral occurrences in nature, and growing computational complexity as the number of identifiable mineral labels increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient mineral identification model based on multi-label image classification, focusing on natural environmental features. First, realistic feature datasets are created by simulating mineral photos in real environments. Then, the model uses the query-label (Query2Label) framework, with MaxViT-T (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer-Tiny) as the feature extraction network and the asymmetric loss function. Knowledge distillation is employed to improve identification accuracy while reducing computational complexity. The proposed model achieves an impressive average identification accuracy of 84.74\% on a dataset of 495,756 mineral photos, surpassing existing models like ResNet-101, ML-GCN (Multi Label Graph Convolutional Network), and SRN (Spatial Regularization Net). It maintains a lower parameter count and computational complexity. In the end, ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each optimization scheme.},

To solve this problem, the use of formal models for scenario or activity generation is essential to ensure a high-quality experience. In this context, the use of Petri nets or automata is widespread. Based on this observation, we propose the formal CIT (content interaction time) model [37], which is dedicated to the development of interactive robotic applications and based on networks of input/output timed automata. In this paper, we propose the use of the CELTIC (Common Editor for Location Time Interaction and Content) and EDAIN (Execution Driver based on Artificial INtelligence) software platforms to allow for a simplified and generic modelling of robotic applications and their supervision based on the CIT model. We used this approach to design a serious game with the humanoid robot Nao.

In this article, we build a knowledge graph about the antiquities trade using a semantic annotation tool, drawing on the series of articles in the Trafficking Culture Project's online encyclopedia. We then use the AmpliGraph package, a series of tools for supervised machine learning (Costabello et al. 2019) to turn the graph into a knowledge graph embedding model. We query the model to predict new hypotheses and to cluster actors in the trade. The model suggests connections between actors and institutions hitherto unsuspected and not otherwise present in the original knowledge graph.

Additionally, the presence of slice marks made with metal objects in Chalcolithic and Bronze Age sites has highlighted the use of metal in common practices beyond their ornamental application, as usually expected at the early stages of metallurgy. Here, we present the study of the slice marks found at the Chalcolithic site of Zanjillas, using geometric morphometrics and machine learning algorithms, with the aim of identifying the nature of the tools used for carcass processing at the site. For this purpose, we replicate previous analyses considering slice marks produced with lint flakes and metal tools to generate a referential framework that serves as comparative to the Zanjillas sample. Our results suggest that most of the domestic activities related to carcass skinning, defleshing, or evisceration in Zanjillas were still performed with flint artefacts.},

Organic materials play an essential role in the degradation of the archaeological organism, while one of the significant dilemmas is identifying the media themselves. Most of these identification methods are destructive. We used a non-destructive analysis technique, namely infrared Raman spectroscopy, to prevent this drawback. The natural polymeric materials represented by hen egg yolk and white were studied as the widely used material starting from the eighteenth dynasty and in the Coptic period in Egypt regarding the interaction between degraded polymers of hen egg yolk and white and elucidate the mechanisms associated with thermally aging egg white and yolk samples. Raman spectroscopy gave valuable results that well illustrated the behavior of aged samples and the interactions between the media used, in addition to dynamic light scattering analysis, which was used to determine the size of proteins, nucleic acids and compounds, to monitor ligand binding, to understand the size of media particles and to draw the carbon footprint of yolks and whites of hen eggs in the steady state and after obsolescence, as these results helped us to preserve, treat and protect precious artifacts..},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel methodology developed for creating 3D models of archaeological artifacts that reduces the time and effort required by operators. The approach uses a simple vision system mounted on a robotic arm that follows a predetermined path around the object to be reconstructed. The robotic system captures different viewing angles of the object and assigns 3D coordinates corresponding to the robot's pose, allowing it to adjust the trajectory to accommodate objects of various shapes and sizes. The angular displacement between consecutive acquisitions can also be fine-tuned based on the desired final resolution. This flexible approach is suitable for different object sizes, textures, and levels of detail, making it ideal for both large volumes with low detail and small volumes with high detail. The recorded images and assigned coordinates are fed into a constrained implementation of the structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithm, which uses the scale-invariant features transform (SIFT) method to detect key points in each image. By utilising a priori knowledge of the coordinates and SIFT algorithm, low processing time can be ensured while maintaining high accuracy in the final reconstruction.
The use of a robotic system to acquire images at a pre-defined pace ensures high repeatability and consistency across different 3D reconstructions, eliminating operator errors in the workflow. This approach not only allows for comparisons between similar objects but also provides the ability to track structural changes of the same object over time.
Overall, the proposed methodology provides a significant improvement over current photogrammetry techniques by reducing the time and effort required to create 3D models while maintaining a high level of accuracy and repeatability.},

	abstract = {Geometric fracture assembly presents a challenging practical task in archaeology and 3D computer vision. Previous methods have focused solely on assembling fragments based on semantic information, which has limited the quantity of objects that can be effectively assembled. Therefore, there is a need to develop a scalable framework for geometric fracture assembly without relying on semantic information. To improve the effectiveness of assembling geometric fractures without semantic information, we propose a co-creation space comprising several assemblers capable of gradually and unambiguously assembling fractures. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, i.e., the geometric-based collision loss, to address collision issues during the fracture assembly process and enhance the results. Our framework exhibits better performance on both PartNet and Breaking Bad datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art frameworks. Extensive experiments and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which features linear computational complexity, enhanced abstraction, and improved generalization.

This study focuses on the common grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), employing molecular, ampelographic, and morphometric techniques to explore its domestication syndrome. We propose a combined domestication index for grape seeds, integrating six commonly used indices. Logistic regression and randomForest machine learning methods were employed to assess the probability of seed domestication. Analysis involved 4029 seeds from 783 samples, spanning live plants (cultivated, wild, feral), archaeological samples, and fossils. Results indicate a distinct domestication syndrome in grapevine seeds, notably characterized by a long stalk ({\textgreater} 1 mm), with combined index values ranging from 0.83 to 1 and domestication probabilities of 0.75 to 1. This syndrome is prevalent in modern cultivars but absent in wild grapevines, aiding in the differentiation of archaeological materials. While not exclusive to Vitis vinifera, the domestication syndrome is characteristic of it, distinguishing it from wild Vitis sylvestris and suggesting isolated domestication events in a few American and Asian Vitis species. Fossil and archaeological materials exhibit low domestication values, hinting at the beginnings of domestication. However, dating reliability remains a challenge.},

Volcanic rocks are often found in archaeological sites as materials used to make grinding tools such as millstones and mortars or as building materials. Petrographic characterization is commonly applied to identify their main mineralogical components. However, the provenance study of volcanic stones is usually undertaken by comparing geochemical data from reference outcrops using common descriptive statistical tools such as biplots of chemical elements, and occasionally, unsupervised multivariate data analysis like principal component analysis (PCA) is also used. Recently, the use of supervised classification methods has shown a superior performance in assigning provenance to archaeological samples. However, these methods require the use of reference databases for all the possible provenance classes in order to train the classification models. The existence of comprehensive collections of published geochemical analyses of igneous rocks enables the use of the supervised approach for the provenance determination of volcanic stones. In this paper, the provenance of volcanic grinding tools from two archaeological sites (Iulia Libica, Spain, and Sidi Zahruni, Tunisia) is attempted using data from the GEOROC database through unsupervised and supervised approaches. The materials from Sidi Zahruni have been identified as basalts from Pantelleria (Italy), and the agreement between the different supervised classification models tested is particularly conclusive. In contrast, the provenance of the materials from Iulia Libica remained undetermined. The results illustrate the advantages and limitations of all the examined methods.},

As the most informative representative of cultural heritage in the study of historical materials, murals occupy a significant position in archaeology and ancient culture. Currently, most of the existing virtual restoration of murals is limited to the restoration of image information for local damage. The scenes of murals have large spatial scales and complex semantic contents. In order to enhance the semantic relevance of the virtual restoration of murals and the immersion of a visual perception, this paper proposes a kind of mural virtual-real fusion restoration display method based on visual attention mechanism. Based on the case study on the immersive fusion restoration of Dunhuang grotto murals, the feasibility of regional mural image restoration and real space scene fusion restoration is verified. A new paradigm of mural heritage protection in the context of virtual-real fusion is realized. (c) 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Image alignment and registration methods typically rely on visual correspondences across common regions and boundaries to guide the alignment process. Without them, the problem becomes significantly more challenging. Nevertheless, in real world, image fragments may be corrupted with no common boundaries and little or no overlap. In this work, we address the problem of learning the alignment of image fragments with gaps (i.e., without common boundaries or overlapping regions). Our setting is unsupervised, having only the fragments at hand with no ground truth to guide the alignment process. This is usually the situation in the restoration of unique archaeological artifacts such as frescoes and mosaics. Hence, we suggest a self-supervised approach utilizing self-examples which we generate from the existing data and then feed into an adversarial neural network. Our idea is that available information inside fragments is often sufficiently rich to guide their alignment with good accuracy. Following this observation, our method splits the initial fragments into sub-fragments yielding a set of aligned pieces. Thus, sub-fragmentation allows exposing new alignment relations and revealing inner structures and feature statistics. In fact, the new sub-fragments construct true and false alignment relations between fragments. We feed this data to a spatial transformer GAN which learns to predict the alignment between fragments gaps. We test our technique on various synthetic datasets as well as large scale frescoes and mosaics. Results demonstrate our method's capability to learn the alignment of deteriorated image fragments in a self-supervised manner, by examining inner image statistics for both synthetic and real data.},

	abstract = {Sex estimation of the individuals in a sample is fundamental for any bioarchaeological study to define a particular demographic assemblage or to classify isolated remains. Long bones are an excellent alternative for sex estimation when the most dimorphic anatomical parts are not preserved or are highly altered. Here we propose a set of discriminant functions and classification models to estimate the sex of prehistoric individuals using linear discriminant analysis and machine learning approaches. Different osteometric variables were taken from the humeri, ulnae, radii, femurs and tibias of a sample of 109 articulated skeletons buried in the collective tomb of Camino del Molino (Region of Murcia, SE-Spain), dated to the 3rd millennium BC. Sex was estimated based on standard anthropological methods and ancient DNA analysis of a control sample. Fifty-two discriminant functions with prediction thresholds higher than 0.8 on the ROC curve were obtained using independent (22) and combined variables (30). The best LDA models for sex prediction were those based on proximal epiphyseal widths or their combination with other variables, reaching values close to 0.98 on the ROC curve. The random forest-based model obtained an accuracy of 0.94 and confirmed the importance of epiphyseal widths in sex classification. This analysis is more comprehensive than univariate LDA, as it allows for ranking the importance of bones in sex discrimination and considers correlations between long bones rather than treating them as independent observations. In contrast, applying LDA to each bone makes it easier to predict the sex of other coeval collections that do not have such a complete sample. This work aims to overcome the scarcity of methods that can be applied to sex estimation of the large volume of isolated remains from Camino del Molino and for other Mediterranean skeletal series from the Late Prehistory with high biological affinity and that share similar environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Paleolithic lithic assemblages are usually dominated by flakes and display a high degree of morphological variability. When analyzing Paleolithic lithic assemblages, it is common to classify flakes into categories based on their morphological and technological features, which are linked to the position of the flake in the reduction sequence and how removals are organized in a given production method. For the analysis of Middle Paleolithic lithic assemblages, two categories of flakes are commonly identified: core-edge flakes and pseudo-Levallois points. A third type, core-edge flakes with a limited back, is also commonly found in the archaeological literature, providing an alternative category whose definition does not match the two previous types but shares many of their morphological and technological features. The present study addresses whether these three flakes constitute discrete categories based on their morphological and technological attributes. 2D and 3D geometric morphometrics are employed on an experimental set composed of the three categories of flakes to quantify morphological variation. Machine learning models and principal components biplots are used to test the discreteness of the categories. The results indicate that geometric morphometrics succeed in capturing the morphological and technological features that characterize each type of product. Pseudo-Levallois points have the highest discreteness of the three technological products, and while some degree of mixture exists between core edge flakes and core edge flakes with a limited back, they are also highly distinguishable. We conclude that the three categories are discrete and can be employed in technological lists of products for the analysis of lithic assemblages and that geometric morphometrics is useful for testing for the validity of categories. When testing these technological categories, we stress the need for well-defined and shared lithic analytical units to correctly identify and interpret the technical steps and decisions made by prehistoric knappers and to properly compare similarities and differences between stone tool assemblages. These are key aspects for current research in which open datasets are becoming more and more common and used to build interpretative techno-cultural models on large geographical scales. Now more than ever, lithic specialists are aware of the need to overcome differences in taxonomies between different school traditions.},

	abstract = {This research is part of a wider framework of index literature studies that have been conducted in the past few years. Some of these have had a focus on specific remote sensing (RS) technologies, while others have tackled specific threats to cultural heritage and landscapes. By considering both damages to heritage sites and technologies used for documentation and the monitoring of such occurrences, this paper unveils the current trends on a global scale in the study of the threats to heritage caused by both human-induced and natural hazards. Papers published by Europe-based researchers over the last 20 years using RS and Earth Observation (EO) techniques were surveyed alongside recommendations and programmatic documents issued by institutions in charge of heritage protection and management of several countries in Europe. Around 300 documents, including scientific articles (published from 2000 until 2022) and Grey literature (from 2008 and 2022), were analysed. The data collection and analysis were undertaken by a working group that was intentionally composed to bring together diverse perspectives and expertise, i.e., requirements of heritage professionals using RS and EO technologies, knowledge on technologies and their use in the field, and expertise in methodology implementation to support heritage management. The results highlight the type of hazards considered the most and the geographical distribution of the archaeological sites and monuments targeted by these studies; the countries the researchers are affiliated with; the types of RS and specifically satellite-based technologies used (and hence the type of data used); the tendencies of satellite data usage-visual interpretation, image processing, employment of machine learning, and AI; the technologies most applied by public institutions and practitioners; and many others. Recommendations and future trajectories are then outlined to efficiently reframe discrepancies between types of damage that have received the greatest attention in the literature and the most impactful ones in terms of the number of sites damaged.},

	abstract = {The glass relics are precious material evidence of the early trade and cultural exchange between the East and the West. To explore the cultural differences and trade development between early China and foreign countries, it is extremely important to classify glass cultural relics. Despite their similar appearances, Chinese glass contains more lead, while foreign glass contains more potassium. In view of this, this paper proposes a joint Daen-LR, ARIMA-LSTM, and MLR machine learning algorithm (JMLA) for the analysis and identification of the chemical composition of ancient glass. We separate the sampling points of ancient glass into two systems: lead-barium glass and high-potassium glass. Firstly, an improved logistic regression model based on a double adaptive elastic network (Daen-LR) is used to select variables with both Oracle and adaptive classification characteristics. Secondly, the ARIMA-LSTM model was used to establish the correlation curve of chemical composition before and after weathering and to predict the change in chemical composition with weathering. Thirdly, combining the data processed by the above two methods, a multiple linear regression model (MLR) is used to classify unknown glass products. It was shown that the sample obtained by this processing method has a very good fit. In comparison with other similar types of models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests based on classification and regression trees (CART-RF), the classification accuracy of JMLA is 97.9\% on the train set. The accuracy rate on the test set reached 97.6\%. The results of the research demonstrate that JMLA can improve the accuracy of the glass type classification problem, greatly enhance the research efficiency of archaeological staff, and gain a more reliable result.},

Metallic and non-metallic material/object detection is pivotal to various technical applications and paramount in ensuring structural integrity, operational efficiency, and overall safety. This study analyzes a multi-sensor fusion approach for classification of metallic and non-metallic objects in complex soil environments at various depths. The adopted approach is beneficial in scenarios where single-sensor systems fail to provide adequate performance. We investigated the integration of magnetic induction spectroscopy (MIS) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) sensors for binary, soil, depth, and multiclass classification. A dataset comprising 14 objects was trained and tested on six AI models (900 variants). The best-performing 384 model variants, which have the highest accuracy, precision, and recall, reaching 98\%+ and with minimal Type I and II errors, are reported here. The best accuracy for each classification problem (binary, soil type, depth, and multiobject) corresponding to each set of input data (MIS, GPR, and MIS+GPR) has been summarized and reported. The analysis shows that different AI models have performed better in different scenarios. The study's implications extend to defense, archeology, and geology, offering enhanced object detection in complex soil environments. These findings underscore the multi-sensor fusion approach's significance for advancements in remote sensing and classification technologies.},

The use of an appropriate transformation for composi-tional data, whose geometric space is the Simplex, is emphasized. The comparison revealed the ability of the models to cluster data in multiple phases, showing to be more convenient to select the relevant variables than to perform an analysis based on 2D plots or by simultaneously including all the available variables in a multivariate analysis. Once the informative variables for the clustering were obtained, we used a method called Databionic Swarm (DBS). This method uses unsupervised machine learning, taking advantage of emergence and swarm intelligence applied to find natural chemical groups in the input data space. DBS can visualize high-dimensional distances in the projection through a 3D topographic map with hypsometric tints. The results were compared in terms of accuracy, both in the selection of the variables and in the classification, using a supervised accuracy index for clustering and two unsupervised indexes (the Heatmap and the Silhouette plot). The concepts and methods were illustrated by applying them to two published archaeological glass data sets. The first set consisted of 245 Romano-British glass vessels and the second set of 180 glass vessels from the 15th-17th century in Antwerp. In these applications, it was found that the methods for the selection of variables increased the ac-curacy of the classification compared to traditional methods.},

The paper aims to review the limitations of this approach, by answering the question as to how much information from the original knapping process is still preserved in the cores and bifaces. To quantify the information loss we used experimentally knapped pieces, that we then refitted to check which removals are still visible on the surface of the analysed forms. We tested different measures of information loss in the context of removals and sequences of removals, but also the chronological relationship between sequences i.e. the number of linear extensions and missing nearest connections. On average, 39.9\% of the original removals and 54.1\% of the sequences of removals are preserved on the surface, but only 14.1\% of the original relationships between sequences can be observed. Finally, we used simple machine learning to find an algorithm for estimating the loss of the nearest chronological relationships between sequences when no refits are available. Due to the extremely high information loss for the linear order of the knapping process we: a) propose to abandon these elements of the diacritic approach which aim to reconstruct the rhythms and schemes of knapping; b) evaluate the quality of the reconstructed knapping scheme (partial order) prior to further comparative analyses. Here we propose an algorithm to estimate the number of missing connections to test the quality of the knapping process while using diacritic schemes.},

Although deep learning has succeeded in image classification without handcrafted features, certain studies underscore the continued significance of image preprocessing for enhanced performance during the training process. Nonetheless, this task is often demanding and requires high-quality images to effectively train a classification model. The quality of training images, along with other factors, impacts the classification model's performance and insufficient image quality can lead to suboptimal classification performance. On the other hand, achieving high-quality training images requires effective image preprocessing techniques. In this study, we perform exploratory experiments aimed at improving a classification model of unexposed potsherd cavities images via image preprocessing pipelines. These pipelines are evaluated on two distinct image sets: a laboratory-made, experimental image set that contains archaeological images with controlled lighting and background conditions, and a J \& omacr;mon-Yayoi image set that contains images of real-world potteries from the J \& omacr;mon period through the Yayoi period with varying conditions. The best accuracy performances obtained on the experimental images and the more challenging J \& omacr;mon-Yayoi images are 90.48\% and 78.13\%, respectively. The comprehensive analysis and experimentation conducted in this study demonstrate a noteworthy enhancement in performance metrics compared to the established baseline benchmark.},

A prediction framework based on hybrid deep learning is proposed to realize real-time prediction of thrust.

To enhance the interpretability of the method, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and causal discovery models are introduced within the framework. Taking the salvage project of the "Yangtze Estuary No. 2 '' shipwreck as a case study, the prediction performance of the model is verified. The results show that the pro-posed model achieves excellent performance in thrust prediction for underwater curved pipe jacking, with an average MAE of 11.07 kN, RMSE of 13.96 kN, and R2 value of 0.934. The SHAP analysis reveals that angle, buried depth, and stratum changes exert significant influences on thrust. Furthermore, the spatial correlation and temporal correlation among features are revealed. Compared to other models, the proposed model exhibits su-perior prediction accuracy and is capable of handling various time step sizes, thereby providing valuable decision support for curved pipe jacking thrust prediction.},

Notwithstanding the stratabound nature of mineralisation, the distribution of Zn-Pb lodes is controlled by extensional shears and fold closures. Silver shows a distinct association with lead mineralisation. The presence of over 100 old working sites and several dumped metallurgical residues, spread over an area of over 50 sq km, bear testimony to the thriving mining and metallurgical operations in ancient to medieval times in Zawar and adjoining areas. The old workings were opened as deep linear trenches along with steeply inclined shafts that eventually opened into underground mining stopes supported by flared pillars. The ancient miners could perfect high-temperature zinc distillation processes in well-designed furnaces, and Zawar, therefore, holds the distinction of being the first centre, producing pure zinc on an industrial scale in the world. The most notable feature of Zawar Zn-Pb belt is the high preservation potential of excellently developed sedimentological and structural features that have received attention of researchers from different parts of the world. The Zawar is a seat of learning various facets of mineral exploration and has indeed turned out to be a unique set of geosites. The extensive network of old workings and well-preserved evidence of its being the earliest zinc metal-producing centre lends the status of geodiversity to the Zawar geosites. The ancient to medieval age cultural features emerging from the archaeological findings, and the historic significance of some of the old workings further add to the geodiversity of Zawar.

	abstract = {The present study seeks to better understand the coupling of social and biophysical systems during the late Pleistocene and Holocene, a period characterized by changing interglacial conditions as well as human population expansion and intensified ecosystem management. The approach consists of a combination of patch-based archaeological survey methods, sediment column sampling for paleoenvironmental data, geospatial analysis, and machine learning for chronological unmixing, allowing the systematic evaluation of the distribution and in-tensity of prehistoric land use in the study area of eastern Mediterranean Iberia. Occupational and Land Use Intensity maps developed from continuous distributions of surface artifacts as well as a summed probability density curve developed from 14C dates indicate low but steady human presence in the study area during the Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic with a marked decrease of human presence across the Pleistocene/ Holocene boundary. The Early (and Middle) Neolithic saw the most ubiquitous and intensive occupation of the study area followed by a significant decline during the Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic. The charcoal analysis also supports this pattern. Early Neolithic farming strategies may not have been damaging initially during the climatic regime of the Early Holocene but exacerbated the impacts of higher temperatures and summer droughts, with a loss of the most productive farmland, seen at the onset of the Late Neolithic. Similar boom-bust population trends have been documented throughout Europe during these same time spans and may indicate a recursive interaction or "coupling" between global and regional climate events and human land use strategies.},

	abstract = {Nuclear industrial archaeology utilises radiation mapping and characterisation technologies to gain an insight into the radiological footprint of industrial heritage sites. Increased concentrations of naturally occurring radioactive materials at legacy mine sites are the result of elemental enrichment during coal mining and subsequent combustion. Public safety is of concern around these sites, and therefore, an increased understanding of their associated hazard is essential. Using coincident laser scanning and gamma detection technologies, this study sought to assess the radiological legacy of a coal mine located in Bristol, UK. From this, we can increase our understanding of the residual footprints associated with the local coal mining industry. Samples taken from inside the site were characterised using high resolution gamma spectrometry, wherein the radionuclide content and activities of samples were then quantified. An area of elevated low-level radioactivity was observed at and around buildings believed to belong to the colliery, while Th, U, and K are confirmed at the site from photopeak's of daughter radionuclides. Activities of the radionuclides K-40, U-238, and Th-232 were further quantified during subsequent laboratory analysis. Results highlight an enrichment of naturally occurring radionuclides when compared with global averages for unburned coal. Employing these techniques at further legacy sites would enable an increased understanding of the lasting traces of the coal mining industry, with a focus on NORM enrichment in residual fly ash.},

	abstract = {In the investigation, protection and restoration of murals, the exact location and size of fragmentation disease can be labeled to facilitate the subsequent protection and cultural heritage of murals. However, manual labeling is time-consuming and laborious, and the results will be various due to the different experience of experts, which is not conducive to the promotion of intelligent cultural relic protection and restoration. The intelligent labeling of mural diseases through artificial intelligence can greatly improve the efficiency of mural restoration and solve these deficiencies. Therefore, an intelligent labeling method for mural fragments based on gradient-trainable Gabor and U-Net is proposed. In this paper, the disease labeling problem is transformed into the image segmentation problem for disease regions. However, due to the rich texture of the mural image and the complex edges of the fragmentation regions, a lot of detail is lost for disease labeling directly using the U-Net network. Different from previous studies, this method uses gradient-trained Gabor in the encoders to extract texture features of fragmentation disease and obtain more texture information of the disease region. In particular, res2convolution is embedded into the skip connections to narrow the semantic gap between encoder and decoder and better inject the texture information of fragmentation disease into the deep network. Finally, we proved that the method proposed in this paper can realize the intelligent labeling of fragmentation diseases accurately and efficiently through the murals of Han Tomb at Xi 'an Jiaotong},

Currently, the reassembly and completion of fragmented ceramics is a daunting and time-consuming task, done almost exclusively by hand, which requires the physical manipulation of the fragments. To overcome the challenges of manual reconstruction, reduce the materials' exposure and deterioration, and improve the quality of reconstructed samples, we present IberianVoxel, a novel 3D Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (3D AE-GAN) framework tested on an extensive database with complete and fragmented references. We generated a collection of 1001 3D voxelized samples and their fragmented references from Iberian wheel-made pottery profiles. The fragments generated are stratified into different size groups and across multiple pottery classes. Lastly, we provide quantitative and qualitative assessments to measure the quality of the reconstructed voxelized samples by our proposed method and archaeologists' evaluation.},

	abstract = {Sustainable pedagogical approaches and practices have changed during the years, generating a set of philosophical, theoretical, and scientific concepts. Inside them, regenerative design is a proactive method based on systemic frameworks and developmental processes for maintaining the integrity of natural ecosystems, also enhancing human life, environmental awareness, social equity, and economic sustainability through the support of codesign techniques. This approach is widely used in architectural design, both for existing and heritage buildings, to address negative impacts of global warming, climate change, urban sprawl, touristic pressure, and other contemporary challenging phenomena. Specific workflows for archaeological sites have been never proposed, despite the fact that these sites face problems and risks completely different from other cultural heritage settings (e.g., physical development, pollution, tourism pressure, vandalism, looting, inappropriate excavations or interventions, lack of maintenance, funding, and legislation). This study presents a multicriteria decision analysis workflow for preserving and regenerating archaeological sites in a sustainable way through a deep understanding of current problems, values, features, and risks at urban and building levels. This method is tested with a pedagogical experiment at the UNESCO Site of Casterseprio (Italy), to investigate the interaction between heritage, environmental, social, and economic dynamics as well as to define its feasibility, applicability, limitations, and opportunities for further developments. The didactic process is supported by a participatory program among the key players of the site (owners, heritage and public authorities, and local associations), to create strong public support and a shared vision of the sustainable regeneration of the area. Differences between traditional and regenerative design processes, key design principles, shared criteria, replicability, novelty, and limitations of the pedagogic approach are also identified. Key findings of the present study are: (i) students need clear and shared design workflows for supporting their design projects; (ii) "regenerative design" involves multilevel dynamic training methodologies that motivate and involve the student while also improving their consciousness; (iii) the cooperation and the involvement of the stakeholders is important to favor a human-centered approach based also on social and economic interactions; (iv) digital technologies are fundamental for quantifying the key performance indicators in each design stage; (v) "regenerative design" boosts long-term planning and financial self-sustainability of the intervention; and (vi) multicultural design teams producing more innovative design ideas.},

The example confirms that supervised methods are able to distinguish classes with similar features, and provenancing is achievable. The provided code contains self-explanatory notes to guide the users through the classification algorithms. Archaeometrists without previous knowledge of R should be able to apply the novel methodology to similar well-constrained classification problems.

We  offer an alternative approach, informed by methods borrowed from the geographic  information sciences and using recent advances in computer science, to more  efficiently predict where fossil localities might be found. Our model uses an  artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained to recognize the spectral  characteristics of known productive localities and other land cover classes, such  as forest, wetlands, and scrubland, within a study area based on the analysis of  remotely sensed (RS) imagery. Using these spectral signatures, the model then  classifies other pixels throughout the study area. The results of the neural  network classification can be examined and further manipulated within a  geographic information systems (GIS) software package. While we have developed  and tested this model on fossil mammal localities in deposits of Paleocene and  Eocene age in the Great Divide Basin of southwestern Wyoming, a similar  analytical approach can be easily applied to fossil-bearing sedimentary deposits  of any age in any part of the world. We suggest that new analytical tools and  methods of the geographic sciences, including remote sensing and geographic  information systems, are poised to greatly enrich paleoanthropological  investigations, and that these new methods should be embraced by field workers in  the search for, and geospatial analysis of, fossil primates and hominins.},

We find a  recurrent bimodal distribution of high-frequency variants, but also evidence for  specific enrichments of gene categories in distinct time windows, pointing to  different periods of phenotypic changes, resulting in a mosaic. With a temporal  classification of genetic mutations in hand, we then applied a machine learning  tool to predict what genes have changed more in certain time windows, and which  tissues these genes may have impacted more.

Additionally, qanat(s), or ancient underground channels having surface access holes, and mounded sites, which have distinctive hill-shaped features, are also identified. Other classes are also possible, and the tool helps users make their own training-based approach and feature identification classes.

The overall architecture is applied on data collected from actual visits to the archaeological sites of Gournia and Catalhoyuk and extensive analysis on visitor movement patterns follows, especially in comparison to the curated paths in the aforementioned sites.

This traditional approach has been challenged, however, by the current new practices in archaeological studies, which tend to rely on more scientific methods (e.g. information systems) to understand the wider context of the socio-cultural aspects of past societies. For example, the Nabataean studies, which for more than seventeen decades after the rediscovery of Petra in 1812, are based on the art historical analysis of the rock-cut facades of the the city of Petra. The wider story of the socio-cultural, political, and economic aspects of the Nabataean culture is still not well understood. Just recently archaeological research was undertaken to improve the understanding of the Nabaatean phenomenon from outside Petra. This paper discusses this new attempt to investigate the spatial organization and land use of Wadi Musa during the Nabataean period based on GIS analysis and new archaeological discoveries. Utilizing GIS in discovering historical phenomena provides a new perspective for analysis, whereby structures are treated not as individual archaeological items but rather as a system. This paper also presents a case study that demonstrates the significance of using GIS for historical research by shedding light on the temporal variation of Wadi Musa settlements with special focus on the paleo-landuse of the Nabatean period. The resulting reconstructed map indicates that Wadi Musa was well planned with special zones for elite residents, industry, rural communities, and agriculture. Social segregation/stratification is also well indicated in the plan of the city. The reconstructed map indicates that the strategy for Nabataean land use for Wadi Musa was to use it as a green zone around the city of Gaia.},

	abstract = {The transition to agriculture is regarded as a major turning point in human history. In the present contribution we propose to look at it through the lens of  ethnographic data by means of a machine learning approach. More specifically, we  analyse both the subsistence economies and the socioecological context of 1290  societies documented in the Ethnographic Atlas with a threefold purpose: (i) to  better understand the variability and success of human economic choices; (ii) to  assess the role of environmental settings in the configuration of the different  subsistence economies; and (iii) to examine the relevance of fishing in the  development of viable alternatives to cultivation. All data were extracted from  the publicly available cross-cultural database D-PLACE. Our results suggest that  not all subsistence combinations are viable, existing just a subset of successful  economic choices that appear recurrently in specific ecological systems. The  subsistence economies identified are classified as either primary or mixed  economies in accordance with an information-entropy-based quantitative criterion  that determines their degree of diversification. Remarkably, according to our  results, mixed economies are not a marginal choice, as they constitute 25\% of the  cases in our data sample. In addition, fishing seems to be a key element in the  configuration of mixed economies, as it is present across all of them.},

However, determination of temperatures to which flint artefacts were exposed is  impeded by the chemical and structural variability of flint. Here we combine  Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to build temperature-estimation models to  infer the degree of pyro-technological control effected by inhabitants of the  late Lower Palaeolithic (Acheulo-Yabrudian) site of Qesem Cave, Israel.  Temperature estimation shows that blades were heated at lower median temperatures  (259 °C) compared to flakes (413 °C), whereas heat-induced structural flint  damage (for example, pot-lids and microcracks) appears at 447 °C.

	abstract = {Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems.
In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria.
When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

When only a few segments of the original piece are available, solutions exclusively based on computational algorithms are inefficient when attempting to create a credible whole restoration. Incomplete 3D puzzles must consequently be tackled by considering hybrid human/computer strategies. This paper presents a reconstruction approach in which the knowledge of human experts and computational solutions coexist together. Hypotheses, models and integration solutions originating from both humans and computers are thus continuously updated until an agreement is reached. This semi-automatic restoration approach has been tested on a set of ancient fractured pieces belonging to the remains of Roman sculptures at the well known Merida site (Spain), and promising results have been obtained. The successful results and applicability of this method have led us to believe that computational solutions should evolve towards hybrid human-computer strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The first  applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such  as the three-circle model for 3 × 3 pixel patches from natural images, or the  configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with a Klein  bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of global shape,  short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise. More recently,  however, persistent homology has been used to address questions about the local  geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be vectorized for use in  machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its vectorization methods,  including persistence landscapes and persistence images, provide popular  techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global topology into machine  learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are as important as the long  bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of this claim, we survey  applications of persistent homology to shape recognition, agent-based modeling,  materials science, archaeology, and biology. Additionally, we survey work  connecting persistent homology to geometric features of spaces, including  curvature and fractal dimension, and various methods that have been used to  incorporate persistent homology into machine learning.},

	abstract = {The task of assembling fragments in a puzzle-like manner into a composite picture plays a significant role in the field of archaeology as it supports researchers in their attempt to reconstruct historic artifacts. In this article, we propose a method for matching and assembling pairs of ancient papyrus fragments containing mostly unknown scriptures. Papyrus paper is manufactured from papyrus plants and therefore portrays typical thread patterns resulting from the plant's stems. The proposed algorithm is founded on the hypothesis that these thread patterns contain unique local attributes such that nearby fragments show similar patterns reflecting the continuations of the threads. We posit that these patterns can be exploited using image processing and machine learning techniques to identify matching fragments. The algorithm and system which we present support the quick and automated classification of matching pairs of papyrus fragments as well as the geometric alignment of the pairs against each other. The algorithm consists of a series of steps and is based on deep-learning and machine learning methods. The first step is to deconstruct the problem of matching fragments into a smaller problem of finding thread continuation matches in local edge areas (squares) between pairs of fragments. This phase is solved using a convolutional neural network ingesting raw images of the edge areas and producing local matching scores. The result of this stage yields very high recall but low precision. Thus, we utilize these scores in order to conclude about the matching of entire fragments pairs by establishing an elaborate voting mechanism. We enhance this voting with geometric alignment techniques from which we extract additional spatial information. Eventually, we feed all the data collected from these steps into a Random Forest classifier in order to produce a higher order classifier capable of predicting whether a pair of fragments is a match. Our algorithm was trained on a batch of fragments which was excavated from the Dead Sea caves and is dated circa the 1st century BCE. The algorithm shows excellent results on a validation set which is of a similar origin and conditions. We then tried to run the algorithm against a real-life set of fragments for which we have no prior knowledge or labeling of matches. This test batch is considered extremely challenging due to its poor condition and the small size of its fragments. Evidently, numerous researchers have tried seeking matches within this batch with very little success. Our algorithm performance on this batch was sub-optimal, returning a relatively large ratio of false positives. However, the algorithm was quite useful by eliminating 98\% of the possiblematches thus reducing the amount of work needed formanual inspection. Indeed, experts that reviewed the results have identified some positive matches as potentially true and referred them for further investigation.},

	abstract = {The balance of power (that is the dominance on the predation arena between carnivore competitors and hominins) remains controversial. One reflection of this is the carnivore modification of hominin bones. During human evolution, hominins were first prey and then predators of other animals, including carnivores. Modifications reported on some hominin bones could result from primary predators feeding on them or post-depositional modifications by scavengers. Determining carnivore agency would be crucial to interpret such information. Here, a series of computer vision models based on convolutional neural networks is presented, comparing five different types of carnivores jointly and then pairwise. It is shown how such models contain different heuristics regarding specific carnivore taxa, which regarding tooth marks made by lions and spotted hyenas can be accurately classified by as much as 92\% of the testing set. The present study also shows the potential of transfer knowledge in building accurate classification of images and for taphonomic interpretation. The application to tooth marking on a 500 ka hominin femoral shaft indicates that by that time, carnivore modifications of human remains may have resulted from post-depositional scavenging rather than by predation.},

Other researchers have argued that multivariate methods can efficiently separate both types of marks. Differentiating both taphonomic agents is crucial for determining the ear-liest evidence of carcass processing by hominins. Here, we use an updated machine learning approach (discarding artificially bootstrapping the original imbalanced samples) to show that microscopic features shaped as categorical variables, corresponding to intrinsic properties of mark structure, can accurately discriminate both types of bone modifications. We also implement new deep-learning methods that objectively achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating cut marks from crocodile tooth scores (99\% of testing sets). The present study shows that there are precise ways of differentiating both taphonomic agents, and this invites taphonomists to apply them to controversial paleontological and archaeological specimens.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The similarity measurements are based on the outer shape contours of the artifacts. The system can speed up the process of classifying historical glass, and make it more objective and controllable.

Despite the  interest over these latter approaches, there has been variation in the quality  with which these methods have been applied.

When  evaluated correctly, the results establish high model classification performance,  with Random Forest leading with an average accuracy of 85\% (measured through F1  Scores), and with Support Vector Machines following closely.

These inferences depend on accurately identifying the clade to  which the fossils belong. Patterns of GSSCP shape and size variation across the  family have not been established and current classification methods are  subjective or based on a 2D view that ignores important 3D shape variation.  Focusing on Poaceae subfamilies Anomochlooideae, Pharoideae, Pueliodieae,  Bambusoideae and Oryzoideae, we observed in situ GSSCP to establish their  orientation and imaged isolated GSSCP using confocal microscopy to produce 3D  models. 3D geometric morphometrics was used to analyze GSSCP shape and size.  Classification models were applied to GSSCP from Eocene sediments from Nebraska,  USA, and Anatolia, Turkey. There were significant shape differences between  nearly all recognized GSSCP morphotypes and between clades with shared  morphotypes. Most of the Eocene GSSCP were classified as woody bamboos with some  distinctive Nebraska GSSCP classified as herbaceous bamboos. 3D morphometrics  hold great promise for GSSCP classification. It accounts for the complete GSSCP  shape, automates size measurements and accommodates the complete range of  morphotypes within a single analytical framework.},

The potential of the site has been evaluated through multidisciplinary research including taxonomy, anatomy, deep learning, and direct dating of fossil remains. A surface study carried out in 2017, over a very limited area (2 m(2)) on the slope of one of the Ruidera lakes led to the discovery of more than 50 fossil specimens, including cranial (mainly teeth) and postcranial remains. This rich assemblage is dominated by the remains of Caprinae, although the presence of some small or medium carnivore remains also stands out. The identification of a cut mark, tested with Convolutional Neural Networks, suggests the presence of human activity within the bone assemblage. Several fossils were directly dated using a multi-technique approach involving radiocarbon, U-Th, and ESR methods. The results constrain the fossil assemblage to between 300 ka and 400 ka, positioning Los Villares as one of the first Middle Pleistocene localities identified in the Upper Guadiana basin, on the Southern edge of the Southern Iberian Plateau. These promising initial results show the great potential of the site to contribute to filling a gap of knowledge in the Pleistocene archaeo-paleontological record of the Iberian Peninsula. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge the need for systematic excavations in the future, not only to obtain a better idea of the lateral and stratigraphic extension of the fossil assemblage and its complete taxonomic composition, but also to confirm the human presence at the site.},

The Indigenous Xicana/o/xs who belong to many of the mobile tribes of Mesoamerica share a long genealogical history of cultivating and sustaining their Native American rituals, which was weakened in Mexico and the United States during various periods of colonization. This special edition essay sheds light on the story of Quetzalcoatl and the Venus Star as a familial place of Xicana/o/x belonging and practice. To do so, we rely on the archaeological interpretation of these two entities as one may get to know them through artifacts, monuments, and ethnographic accounts, of which some date to Mesoamerica's Formative period (1500-400 BC). Throughout this paper, ancestral medicine ways are shown to help cultivate positive health, learning, and community. Such cosmic knowledge is poorly understood, yet it may further culturally relevant education and the treatment of the rampant health disparities in communities of Mesoamerican ancestry living in the United States.

The objective is to create automated methods for automatically classifying and successively retrieving photographic data leveraging the current breed of AI methods based on Deep Learning paradigm. In this work, the lack of images to be used for the training of the AI system is addressed by testing an approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for automatically synthesizing unrealistic photos, which, in turn, can be used for training image classification and retrieval systems. Specifically, we propose a method to drive the generation of realistic classical order images using GAN approaches anchored to semantic ontology domain representation. More specifically, the proposed AI leverages the advantages of knowledge-based and data-driven methods and foresees a level image generation: the first one that synthesizes isolated objects corresponding to each ontology concept and the second one that, instead, combines the generated objects according to the spatial information provided by the ontology in order to generate realistic scenes. The resulting images can then be employed to train automated classifiers and more reliable retrieval methods by minimizing the efforts usually required by human operators to manually annotate data. In addition, the proposed generative strategy allows for a deeper understanding of cultural heritage visual data enabling the possibility to enhance design capabilities in simulation contexts.},

To our knowledge, existing studies of sex  determination of the skull mostly utilize supervised learning methods to analyze  and classify data and can have limitations when applied to actual cases with the  absence of category labels in the skull samples or a large difference in the  number of male and female samples of the skull. This paper proposes a novel  approach which is based on an unsupervised classification technique in performing  sex determination of the skull of Han Chinese ethnic group. The 78 landmarks on  the outer surface of 3D skull models from computed tomography scans are marked,  and a skull dataset of a total of 40 interlandmark measurements is constructed. A  stable and efficient unsupervised algorithm which we abbreviated as MKDSIF-FCM is  proposed to address the classification problem for the skull dataset. The  experimental results of the adult skull suggest that the proposed MKDSIF-FCM  algorithm warrants fairly high sex determination accuracy for females and males,  which is 98.0\% and 93.02\%, respectively, and is superior to all the  classification methods we attempted. As a result of its fairly high accuracy,  extremely good stability, and the advantage of unsupervised learning, the  proposed method is potentially applicable for forensic investigations and  archaeological studies.},

At present, their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification and regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual approaches with machine learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives on the classification and attribution of this Iron Age corpus.
The study sample consists of 162 sculptures of female figures that have been conventionally attributed to three main regional carving traditions: "Phoenician," "North Syrian," and "Syrian/South Syrian". We have developed an algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical classifications, while revealing new insights, especially with regard to the "Syrian/South Syrian" tradition.
Specifically, we have determined that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian tradition might be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects. We also reconsider the classification of a subset of "Phoenician" objects, and we confirm Syrian/South Syrian stylistic subgroups, the geographic distribution of which might illuminate Neo-Assyrian acquisition networks. Additionally, we have identified the features in our cluster assignments that might be diagnostic of regional traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual classifications and demonstrates how machine learning techniques may be employed to retrieve complementary information not accessible through an exclusively visual analysis.

The inquiry is based on new methods for image  processing and document analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms. These  techniques enable identification of the minimal number of authors in a given  group of inscriptions. Our algorithmic analysis, complemented by the textual  information, reveals a minimum of six authors within the examined inscriptions.  The results indicate that in this remote fort literacy had spread throughout the  military hierarchy, down to the quartermaster and probably even below that rank.  This implies that an educational infrastructure that could support the  composition of literary texts in Judah already existed before the destruction of  the first Temple. A similar level of literacy in this area is attested again only  400 y later, ca 200 BCE.},

In this paper, we address the problem of classifying and removing caustics from images and propose a novel solution based on two convolutional neural networks: SalienceNet and DeepCaustics. Caustics result in changes in illumination that are continuous in nature; therefore, the first network is trained to produce a classification of caustics that is represented as a saliency map of the likelihood of caustics occurring at a pixel. In applications where caustic removal is essential, the second network is trained to generate a caustic-free image. It is extremely hard to generate real ground truth for caustics. We demonstrate how synthetic caustic data can be used for training in such cases, and then transfer the learning to real data. To the best of our knowledge, out of the handful of techniques that have been proposed, this is the first time that the complex problem of caustic removal has been reformulated and addressed as a classification and learning problem.

	abstract = {The negative selection algorithm is an anomaly detection technique inspired by the self-nonself discrimination behavior observed in the Biological Immune System. The most controversial question of these algorithms is their poor performance on real world applications. To overcome such limitation this research work focuses on generating more efficient detectors through a more flexible boundary for self patterns. Rather than applying conventional affinity measures, the detectors are generated benefiting from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted on normal space. From the GMM capabilities the algorithm is able to dynamically determine efficient subsets of detectors. In order to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, different data sets have been examined as benchmark, including 2D synthesis data sets. Furthermore, for evaluating the capability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on real-world problems, it has been performed and tested for detecting anomalies in archaeological sites located in Lorestan, Iran. The experimental results prove how the proposed approach helps the negative selection algorithm to improve its detection capability, because the detectors can be efficiently distributed into the non-self space. It is important to note how this research work presents also a first analysis of the anomaly detection capabilities in the field of archaeology, introducing a novel application method, which can be efficiently used by the archaeologists for interpreting their growing amount of data and draw valuable conclusions about the historical past. Finally, in order to analyse the convergence and the running time of the proposed algorithm, a study has been conducted using the classical Time-To-Target plots, which present a standard graphical methodology for data analysis based on the comparisons between the empirical and theoretical distributions.

Second, vegetation-index segmentation methods from satellites require manual thresholding, which varies across geographic areas, and are not robust across cities with varying terrain, geometry, altitude, and canopy. In our work, we compensate for the lack of visual detail by using satellite snapshots across twelve months and segment cities into various vegetation clusters. Then, we use multiple GAN-based networks to plant trees by recognizing placement patterns inside segmented regions procedurally. We present comprehensive experiments over four cities (Chicago, Austin, Indianapolis, Lagos), achieving tree count accuracies of 87-97\%.

Ongoing research in underwater robotics intends to increase the autonomy of intervention operations that require physical interaction in order to achieve social benefits in fields such as archaeology or biology that cannot afford the expenses of costly underwater operations using remote operated vehicles. Autonomous grasping is still a very challenging skill, especially in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and adverse conditions that affect the robot perception and control systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the use of vision and segmentation techniques that aim to improve the specification of grasping operations on underwater primitive shaped objects. Several sources of stereo information are used to gather 3D information in order to obtain a model of the object. Using a RANSAC segmentation algorithm, the model parameters are estimated and a set of feasible grasps are computed. This approach is validated in both simulated and real underwater scenarios.},

	abstract = {Seals and sealings were widely used in Neopalatial Crete, primarily in community-wide administrative systems to manage the movement and storage of goods, but also to secure or control channels of intra-site communication using parchment documents. The main principle of this monitoring process was the use of the seal impression as an 'indexical' sign, that is, as a means of identifying a seal-user who was acting in an authorising or securing role. Given the fact that seal-users could be acting on their own behalf or, alternatively, as representatives of an institution, there is uncertainty in the literature still over whether the seal impression stood for a single identifiable individual or not. In this paper, we present a new computational methodology for identifying and quantifying similarity within sets of multiple seal impressions made by the same seal. Using a combination of visualisations derived from computational analysis of 3-D scans, experimental work to make seal impressions, and scrutiny of the relevant sealing casts within the Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Seals, Heidelberg, we are able to identify groups of sealings impressed in significantly similar ways. We consider it probable that seal impressions with a high degree of similarity were made by the same individual or by two or more people trained to work in a very specific way. This computational methodology is transferable and would prove valuable for other collections of material with identifiable repeated visual elements, such as coins. The implications of our research and the nuance it adds to reconstructions of Neopalatial sealing practices are of broader relevance for sphragistic studies, and provide a point of comparison with the contemporary sealing material of the Ancient Near East.},

Alternatively, and most commonly, when there are no changes, we review the CH applications, features and pre/post-processing which make the algorithm suitable for its use. We analyse the dominant divides within ML, Supervised, Semi-supervised and Unsupervised, and reflect on a variety of algorithms that have been extensively used.

	abstract = {Machine Learning-based workflows are being progressively used for the automatic detection of archaeological objects (intended as below-surface sites) in remote sensing data. Despite promising results in the detection phase, there is still a lack of a standard set of measures to evaluate the performance of object detection methods, since buried archaeological sites often have distinctive shapes that set them aside from other types of objects included in mainstream remote sensing datasets (e.g., Dataset of Object deTection in Aerial images, DOTA). Additionally, archaeological research relies heavily on geospatial information when validating the output of an object detection procedure, a type of information that is not normally considered in regular machine learning validation pipelines. This paper tackles these shortcomings by introducing two novel automatic evaluation measures, namely 'centroid-based' and 'pixel-based', designed to encode the salient aspects of the archaeologists' thinking process. To test their usability, an experiment with different object detection deep neural networks was conducted on a LiDAR dataset. The experimental results show that these two automatic measures closely resemble the semi-automatic one currently used by archaeologists and therefore can be adopted as fully automatic evaluation measures in archaeological remote sensing detection. Adoption will facilitate cross-study comparisons and close collaboration between machine learning and archaeological researchers, which in turn will encourage the development of novel human-centred archaeological object detection tools.},

	abstract = {The genetic basis for the emergence of creativity in modern humans remains a mystery despite sequencing the genomes of chimpanzees and Neanderthals, our closest hominid relatives. Data-driven methods allowed us to uncover networks of genes distinguishing the three major systems of modern human personality and adaptability: emotional reactivity, self-control, and self-awareness. Now we have identified which of these genes are present in chimpanzees and Neanderthals. We replicated our findings in separate analyses of three high-coverage genomes of Neanderthals. We found that Neanderthals had nearly the same genes for emotional reactivity as chimpanzees, and they were intermediate between modern humans and chimpanzees in their numbers of genes for both self-control and self-awareness. 95\% of the 267 genes we found only in modern humans were not protein-coding, including many long-non-coding RNAs in the self-awareness network. These genes may have arisen by positive selection for the characteristics of human well-being and behavioral modernity, including creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity. The genes that cluster in association with those found only in modern humans are over-expressed in brain regions involved in human self-awareness and creativity, including late-myelinating and phylogenetically recent regions of neocortex for autobiographical memory in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, as well as related components of cortico-thalamo-ponto-cerebellar-cortical and cortico-striato-cortical loops. We conclude that modern humans have more than 200 unique non-protein-coding genes regulating co-expression of many more protein-coding genes in coordinated networks that underlie their capacities for self-awareness, creativity, prosocial behavior, and healthy longevity, which are not found in chimpanzees or Neanderthals.},

This paper offers an overview of this diluvian information landscape and aims to foster debate about its wider disciplinary impact.

	abstract = {Neanderthals occupied Western Eurasia between 350 ka and 40 ka ago, during the climatically volatile Pleistocene. A key issue is to what extent Neanderthal populations expanded into areas of Western Eurasia and what conditions facilitated such range expansions. The range extent of Neanderthals is generally based on the distribution of Neanderthal material, but the land-altering nature of glacial periods has erased much of the already sparse material evidence of Neanderthals, particularly in the northern latitudes. To overcome this obstacle species distribution models can estimate past distributions of Neanderthals, however, most implementations are generally constrained spatially and temporally and may be artificially truncating the Neanderthal niche space. Using dated contexts from Neanderthal sites from across Western Eurasia, millennial-scale paleoclimate reconstructions, and a spatiotemporal species distribution model, we infer the fundamental climatic niche space of Neanderthals and estimate the extent of Neanderthal occupation. We find that (a.) despite the long timeframe, Neanderthals occupy a relatively narrow fundamental climatic niche space, (b.) the estimated projected potential Neanderthal niche space suggests a larger geographic range than the material record suggests, and (c.) that there was a general decline in the size of the projected potential Neanderthal niche from 145 ka ago onward, possibly contributing to their extinction.},

This research involves archaeological predictive modelling, aiming to create models capable of predicting the likelihood of discovering archaeological sites, cultural resources or evidence of past landscape use within a specific region. The study specifically focuses on predicting the locations of historical sites in the Sahara Desert, employing the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and six geo-environmental criteria, including slope, elevation (digital elevation model [DEM]), distance from water, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fertility and proximity to palm groves. The research is based on data from 58 historical sites and includes an assessment of the model's accuracy. The study highlights the remarkable significance of the fertility variable, which accounts for 94.1\% of the predictive influence, making it the most crucial geo-environmental factor in forecasting the location of historical sites in the Sahara. This underscores its pivotal role in shaping settlement patterns and subsistence strategies within the region, followed by the distance variable from the palm cove (3.2\%) and the distance variable from the river (2.3\%). The MaxEnt model proves to be suitable for predicting historical site positions, with an impressive average area under the ROC curve (AUC) score of 0.859, reflecting its effectiveness. Notably, areas with a high prediction probability are predominantly situated near the Saoura Valley. The study's findings hold the potential to assist planners in safeguarding archaeological sites by avoiding areas where historical sites are likely to be present.},

The imaging technique can extract new  archaeobotanical information from existing archaeobotanical collections as well  as create new archaeobotanical assemblages within ancient ceramics and other  artefact types. The technique could aid in answering archaeobotanical questions  about the early histories of some of the world's most important food crops from  geographical regions with amongst the poorest rates of archaeobotanical  preservation and where ancient plant exploitation remains poorly understood. This  paper reviews current uses of microCT imaging in the investigation of  archaeobotanical questions, as well as in cognate fields of geosciences,  geoarchaeology, botany and palaeobotany. The technique has to date been used in a  small number of novel methodological studies to extract internal anatomical  morphologies and three-dimensional quantitative data from a range of food crops,  which includes sexually-propagated cereals and legumes, and asexually-propagated  underground storage organs (USOs). The large three-dimensional, digital datasets  produced by microCT scanning have been shown to aid in taxonomic identification  of archaeobotanical specimens, as well as robustly assess domestication status.  In the future, as scanning technology, computer processing power and data storage  capacities continue to improve, the possible applications of microCT scanning to  archaeobotanical studies will only increase with the development of machine and  deep learning networks enabling the automation of analyses of large  archaeobotanical assemblages.},

The data was used  to extract information about the important elements using machine learning (ML)  methods. The obtained data show that chromium was the most important element and  was used along with other elements as a fingerprint to distinguish the fragments.  The chemical and statistical analyzes help to establish reference groups for  medieval archeological pottery, which will be used in the future to classify and  identify various unknown sherds. These reference groups serve as baseline data  for determining where the fragments were made and are considered a reasonable  judgment based on experimental data.},

	abstract = {Lidar (light-detection and ranging) has revolutionized archaeology. We are now able to produce high-resolution maps of archaeological surface features over vast  areas, allowing us to see ancient land-use and anthropogenic landscape  modification at previously un-imagined scales. In the tropics, this has enabled  documentation of previously archaeologically unrecorded cities in various  tropical regions, igniting scientific and popular interest in ancient tropical  urbanism. An emerging challenge, however, is to add temporal depth to this  torrent of new spatial data because traditional archaeological investigations are  time consuming and inherently destructive. So far, we are aware of only one  attempt to apply statistics and machine learning to remotely-sensed data in order  to add time-depth to spatial data. Using temples at the well-known massive urban  complex of Angkor in Cambodia as a case study, a predictive model was developed  combining standard regression with novel machine learning methods to estimate  temple foundation dates for undated Angkorian temples identified with remote  sensing, including lidar. The model's predictions were used to produce an  historical population curve for Angkor and study urban expansion at this  important ancient tropical urban centre. The approach, however, has certain  limitations. Importantly, its handling of uncertainties leaves room for  improvement, and like many machine learning approaches it is opaque regarding  which predictor variables are most relevant. Here we describe a new study in  which we investigated an alternative Bayesian regression approach applied to the  same case study. We compare the two models in terms of their inner workings,  results, and interpretive utility. We also use an updated database of Angkorian  temples as the training dataset, allowing us to produce the most current estimate  for temple foundations and historic spatiotemporal urban growth patterns at  Angkor. Our results demonstrate that, in principle, predictive statistical and  machine learning methods could be used to rapidly add chronological information  to large lidar datasets and a Bayesian paradigm makes it possible to incorporate  important uncertainties-especially chronological-into modelled temporal  estimates.},

Although various methods have been proposed,  most of them are subjective and influenced by observers' experiences. In this  study, we aimed to develop a deep learning model for automatic dental age and sex  estimation from orthopantomograms (OPGs) and compare to manual methods. A large  dataset of 15,195 OPGs (age range, 16 {\textasciitilde} 50 years; mean age, 29.65 years ± 9.36  [SD]; 10,218 females) was used to train and test a hybrid deep learning model  which is a combination of convolutional neural network and transformer model. The  final performance of this model was evaluated on additional independent 100 OPGs  and compared to the manual method for external validation. In the test of 1413  OPGs, the mean absolute error (MAE) of age estimation was 2.61 years by this  model. The accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic  curve (AUC) of sex estimation were 95.54\% and 0.984. The heatmap indicated that  the crown and pulp chamber of premolars and molars contain the most age-related  information. In the additional independent 100 OPGs, this model achieved an MAE  of 3.28 years for males and 3.79 years for females. The accuracy of this model  was much higher than that of the manual models. Therefore, this model has the  potential to assist radiologists in automated age and sex estimation.},

	abstract = {Since prehistoric times, the island of Sardinia-in the western Mediterranean-has played a leading role in the dynamics of human population and mobility, in the  circulation of raw materials and artefacts, idioms and customs, of technologies  and ideas that have enriched the biological, linguistic and cultural heritage of  local groups. For the Phoenician and Punic periods (from the 9th to the 3rd  centuries BCE), the ancient site of Nora-in southern Sardinia-represents an  emblematic case in the study of migratory phenomena that occurred on the Island  from the Iron Age until the Roman conquest. Despite the importance of exploring  (and characterising) such movements from a wider bio-cultural perspective, the  application of bio-geochemical tools for geographical provenance to the ancient  skeletal populations of Sardinia is yet scarce. The present work is the first  step towards filling this gap with the development of the first isoscape of  southern Sardinia using new bioavailable Sr isotope data and a machine-learning  approach. From a geolithological point of view, Sardinia is rather heterogeneous  and requires detailed studies to correctly assess the distribution of the  isotopic signature of bioavailable Sr. The random forest model employed here to  construct the Sr isoscape uses several external environmental and geological  variables. The most important predictors are related to age and bedrock type,  with additional input from local soil properties. A 10-fold cross-validation  gives a mean square error of 0.0008 and an R-squared of 0.81, so the model  correctly predicts the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of unknown areas. By using a Bayesian  provenance assignment workflow, we tested the isoscape here produced to determine  the geographic origin and the mobility of archaeological and modern fauna  collected from the Phoenician-Punic site of Nora and the surrounding Pula Plain.  Our results indicate that archaeological sheep and goats (87Sr/86Sr {\textless} 0.7090) are  compatible with areas close to Nora and Pula Plain, in agreement with  archaeological evidence of pastoralism in those areas. Modern wild and  domesticated fauna (87Sr/86Sr {\textgreater} 0.7090) show compatibility with several natural  and anthropogenic locations in southern Sardinia, as expected based on modern  species distribution data. Finally, we discuss the large Sr isotopic variability  of the Nora baseline, where human mobility studies of human cremated and inhumed  individuals are currently underway.},

It would be valuable to know the extent of ADE because of its cultural and environmental importance, but systematic efforts to map its distribution and extent are impractical with traditional field methods. We use remote-sensing imagery and a machine-learning classifier with ground-truthed training data to predict the occurrence of ADE across the 26,000 km2 Territ \& oacute;rio Ind \& iacute;gena do Xingu (TIX) in the southeastern Amazon region of Brazil. We find widespread ADE across the TIX, well beyond previously studied archaeological sites, occupying at least 3-4\% of the land area. We further estimate that the TIX may sequester 9 Mt of carbon within ADE deposits from past human inputs. Our findings show that ancient inhabitants of the TIX substantially modified their environment, highlighting the importance of conserving this natural and cultural resource given threats from climate change and deforestation.
Past human land modification in the Amazon has resulted in nutrient- and carbon-rich soil deposits of great cultural and environmental value. A new remote-sensing and machine-learning approach reveals the extent of Amazonian dark earth and its potentially substantial carbon reservoir.},

For this reason, collecting data in simulations offers a promising alternative, but transferring policy networks from simulation to reality can be challenging due to differences in perception between the virtual and real worlds. This paper proposes a two-level method to bridge the simulation-toreality (sim-to-real) gap for depth images, specifically for autonomous environmental navigation that uses DRL. Simulated depth images are first translated at a perception level through generative adversarial network (GAN) to make them look like real data from a depth sensor. Simulated and GAN-generated depth images are encoded into latent representations, and the encoder is trained in the latent space to make the two images paired. This encoder is trained simultaneously with a reinforcement learning network model to extract domain-invariant and task-relevant features from depth images and map the behavioral similarity of states to the latent space. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap, enabling policies learned in simulation to maintain their control performance in the real world.},

In order to alleviate the impact of unavoidable errors in the local matching phase, we put forth an error assessment criterion calculated from the contour differences at the junctions, a two-stage reassembly strategy involving both initial and candidate phases, and a region completeness evaluation standard based on the size of the background region to gauge the ultimate composition outcomes. Additionally, due to the limited availability of publicly shared datasets at present, we created a dataset comprising 1000 sets of randomly divided irregular fragments for training and testing. The experimental results show the excellent performance of this algorithm in terms of accuracy and completeness in fragment reassembly for both public and self-constructed datasets.},

Here we explore one potential causal phenomenon, climate change, to understand how shifting ecological conditions incentivized adaptation through subsistence economic intensification along the Central Andean coasts. To do so we couple 775 archaeological individuals that have dietary stable isotope data (collagen delta C-13 and delta N-15, hydroxyapatite delta C-13) with spatio-temporal core-based proxies of oceanic sea surface temperature and El Ni \& ntilde;o Southern Oscillation frequency estimates. Using an ensemble machine learning model, we evaluate hypotheses that changes in ocean conditions resulting in decreased marine productivity correspond with isotopic signals of increasing terrestrial resource reliance over the past similar to 7000 years. Results support the hypotheses, and prior work, showing isotopic signatures of diet across the coastal Central Andes reflect greater incorporation of resources indicative of intensification during times when marine productivity was likely depressed. As near-shore marine productivity declined, people adapted in manners that may have both increased their resiliency to climate change and improved their overall subsistence returns, but at higher investment costs. The overall findings support theoretical intensification expectations, suggesting adaptation through intensification represents one of the key factors in understanding broader behavioral transformation in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Implicit information exploration techniques are of great importance for the restoration and conservation of cultural relics. At present, the hyperspectral image analysis technique is one of the main methods to extract hidden information, which mainly contains two analysis methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum noise fraction rotation (MNF), both of which have achieved certain information extraction effects. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and other technologies, nonlinear methods such as neural networks are expected to further improve the effect of implicit information mining. Therefore, this paper is oriented to the problem of extracting hidden information from pottery artifacts and tries to study and explore the hidden information mining method based on deep neural networks, expecting to obtain more stable and richer hidden information. In this paper, an auto-encoder-based implied information mining method is proposed first, and the auto-encoder (AE) framework achieves good performance in feature learning by automatically learning low-dimensional embedding and reconstructing data. However, during the experiments, it is found that some important detailed information (e.g., implicit information) is often lost in the reconstruction process because the traditional autoencoder network only focuses more on the pixel-level reconstruction loss and ignores the overall distribution. Therefore, this paper further proposes a multi-scale convolutional autoencoder network (MSCAE). It constructs a multi-scale convolutional module based on the traditional AE and designs a cyclic consistency loss in addition to the reconstruction loss, to reduce the loss of detailed information in the reconstruction process and improve the implicit information mining effect. In the experiments, we find that the proposed method can achieve effective implied information mining by extracting implied information from cocoon-shaped pots, and its visual effect has been improved compared with the traditional AE network.},

This is crucial to understand the trade networks between regions, but highly complex and time-consuming task.

Inspired by experimental archaeology, we created wheel facsimiles to supplement significantly the database with numerous plausible and clearly identified samples. Taking advantage of the powerful convolutional neural network EfficientNet to extract reliable discriminating features, experimental results show that the facsimiles significantly improve the networks' training to achieve a classification accuracy exceeding 95\% on real sherds. On the other hand, unsupervised spectral clustering from a vector reduced to a few hundred of the most significant features delivered by the network EfficientNet-B5 trained on ImageNet, without any fine-tuning, achieves an accuracy of 77.47\% on our database. These results validate the strategy of using facsimiles to supplement a too-small data set and are very promising for the development of a computer-assisted archaeology tool for pattern-wheel association.},

Lower antenna frequencies penetrate deeper but at lower resolutions, while higher frequencies offer detailed images at reduced depths. Therefore, improving the resolution of low-frequency radar with increased detection depth is an essential research focus. Inspired by image super-resolution advancements, supervised deep learning methods that rely on strictly paired training data have achieved remarkable success. However, acquiring such paired samples in practical scenarios is often a formidable challenge. To tackle this, we propose a novel resolution enhancement technique through weakly supervised learning, effectively addressing the scarcity of strictly paired samples in real-world situations. We utilize two sets of antennas with different central frequencies to construct our training data, with a low-frequency antenna as input and a high-frequency antenna as the learning target. A cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (Cycle-GAN) is trained to discern the mapping between low-resolution inputs and unpaired high-resolution data. The refined network is then employed to improve low-frequency GPR data resolution. Our work is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed method effectively strengthens critical high-frequency details for finer imaging and broadens the frequency bandwidth. Significantly, it enhances resolution without compromising the detection depth of low-resolution GPR data, marking a substantial advancement in subsurface imaging technology.},

	abstract = {Qanats are a remarkable type of ancient hydraulic structure for sustainable water distribution in arid environments that use subterranean channels to transport water from highland or mountainous areas. The presence of the qanat system is marked by a line of regularly spaced shafts visible from the surface, which can be used to detect qanats using satellite imagery. Typically, qanats have been documented by field mapping or manual digitisation within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. This process is time-consuming due to the numerous shafts within each qanat line. However, several automated methods for detecting qanat structures have been explored, using techniques such as morphological filters, custom convolutional neural networks (CNN) and, more recently, YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN. These approaches used high-resolution RGB images and CORONA images. However, the use of black and white CORONA in CNNs has been limited in its applicability due to a high rate of false positives. This paper explores the potential of YOLOv9 in processing the black and white HEXAGON (KH-9) highresolution spy satellite system launched in 1971. Two areas in Afghanistan (Maiwand) and Iran (Gorgan Plain) were selected to train the system images extracted from HEXAGON imagery and artificial synthetic data. The training dataset was augmented using the Albumentation library, which increased the number of tiles used. The model was tested using two types of HEXAGON imagery for selected areas in Afghanistan (Maiwand), Iran (Gorgan Plain) and Morocco (Rissani), and CORONA imagery in Iran (Gorgan Plain). Our study provided a model capable of predicting the location of qanat shafts with a precision of over 0.881 and a recall of 0.627 for most of the case studies tested. This is the first case study aimed at detecting qanats in different landscapes using different types of satellite imagery. Using real, augmented, and artificial data allowed us to generalise the representation of qanats into lineal groups of circular features. Thanks to applying labelling for individual qanats and their pairs as separate classes, our approach eliminated most of the isolated and clustered false positives.},

Neanderthal groups have clearly shown a great variety of subsistence activities and the use of carnivoran resources, until rare, is also present in some archaeological sites. However, the identification of the bone surface modifications (BSM) that allow us to infer the presence of anthropogenic marks in faunal remains are usually difficult to be differentiate among other BSM. Recently, several statistical and computing techniques have been developed to differentiate among different types of BSM in an objective way. To date, the most powerful approach is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are the essential part of what is referred to as Deep Learning. In this work, ResNet50 and Inception V3 models are used through transfer learning. The algorithm architecture reaches an accuracy of {\textgreater}96.3\% when differentiating among experimental trampling, cut and tooth marks. Once the transfer models were re-trained with the experimental BSM, they were used to classify several archaeological BSM previously identified as cut marks by human analysts. These BSM have been found on a bear ulna and on a hyena phalanx, both recovered at the Navalma \& iacute;llo Rock Shelter (Madrid, Spain). The BSM located on the hyaena phalanx have been identified as cut marks with a high probability while marks on the bear ulna are non-anthropogenic. This bone adds to the existing sample of anthropogenically-modified carnivoran elements by Neanderthal populations and hint to use of carnivore pelts by Neanderthals.},

	abstract = {Lithic artefacts are usually associated with the different knapping methods used in their production. Flakes exhibit metric and technological features representative of the flaking method used to detach them. However, lithic production is a dynamic process in which discrete methods can be blurred, and in which features can vary throughout the process. An intermediate knapping method between the discoid and Levallois is commonly referred to under an umbrella of terms (the present research uses the term hierarchical discoid), and is associated with a broad geographical and chronological distribution throughout the Early and Middle Palaeolithic. This intermediate knapping strategy exhibits features of both the discoid and Levallois knapping methods, raising the question of the extent to which flakes from the three knapping methods can be differentiated and, when one is mistaken for another, the direction of confusion. An experimental assemblage of flakes detached by means of the three methods was used along with an attribute analysis and machine learning models in an effort to identify the knapping methods employed. In general, our results were able to very effectively differentiate between the three knapping methods when a support vector machine with polynomial kernel was used. Our results also underscored the singularity of flakes detached by means of Levallois reduction sequences, which yielded outstanding identification values, and were rarely erroneously attributed to either of the other two knapping methods studied. Mistaking the products of the discoid and hierarchical discoid methods was the most common direction of confusion, although a good identification value was achieved for discoid flakes and an acceptable value for hierarchical discoid flakes. This shows the potential applicability of machine learning models in combination with attribute analysis for the identification of these knapping methods among flakes.},

Thanks to the spread of new technologies, the possibility of applying innovative approaches to historical heritage is becoming increasingly real, in order to monitor in real time the progressive damage of structures or intercept any sudden risk situations. In this scenario, a significant contribution is made by the paradigm of the Internet of Things, which enables the collection in real time, of data from sensors installed on the structures to be monitored, and the concept of the Digital Twin, which represents a digital copy of reality, and can be utilized for practical purposes, such as simulations and tests. To make the Digital Twin even more effective, it is possible to link it to the real structure through HBIM, which is a process that aims not only at the mere restitution of the tridimensional model but at the creation of so-called "smart models", in which all the components are parametric objects with well-defined semantics and capable of containing all the information useful for understanding the artifact. The paper, therefore, presents a methodology to consider HBIM models as Digital Twins enriched with data from real-time IoT devices placed on the structures to be monitored. The proposed methodology was applied to a real case study within the Velia Archaeological Park: Porta Rosa, which is the oldest known example of a round arch in Italy. The first results of the experiment are more than satisfactory.},

To this end, we propose a hybrid attention module, composed of intra and inter attention layers, enabling capturing of crucial contextual information within fragments and relative structural knowledge across fragments. Furthermore, we propose an adjacency aware hierarchical pose estimator, exploiting a decompose and integrate strategy. It progressively predicts adjacent probability and relative poses between fragments, and then implicitly infers their absolute poses by dynamic information integration.

Apart from the historical and archaeological interest in finding wrecks, there are other reasons why we need to know their precise locations. While a shipwreck can provide an excellent habitat for marine life, acting as an artificial reef, shipwrecks are also potential sources of pollution, leaking fuel and corroding heavy metals. When a vessel runs aground on an iron-free environment, changes in the chemistry of the surrounding environment can occur, creating a discoloration called black reef. In this work, we examine the use of supervised deep learning methods for the detection of shipwrecks on coral reefs through the presence of this discoloration using satellite images. One of the main challenges is the limited number of known locations of black reefs, and therefore, the limited training dataset. Our results show that even with relatively limited data, the simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network has been trained efficiently using minimal computational resources and has identified and classified all investigated black reefs and consequently the presence of shipwrecks. Furthermore, it has proven to be a useful tool for monitoring the extent of discoloration and consequently the ecological impact on the reef by using time series imagery.},

We first test the simple synthetic case of two vertical faults, to understand the robustness of the method. We recognize three classes based on their centroids and find that the source edges could be detected at the transition between the two of them. Subsequently, we apply the UBA to the real magnetometric data of the archaeological site of Torre Galli (Calabria, Italy). We com-pare the results with those from two different boundary analysis techniques, the enhanced horizontal derivative and the tilt derivative. The main sources are well recognized by our approach and in good agreement with the enhanced horizontal derivative results, but UBA leads us to have a more complete description of the lineaments and to retrieve further features of archaeologic interest in the area. Instead, the tilt derivative features are affected by noise, which makes interpretation more complicated.},

	abstract = {Teeth from the Family Bovidae that are associated with our early humans ancestors are important for reconstructing paleoenvironments. However, age, degree of attrition, and taphonomic factors often make fossil identification difficult. A recent technique for classifying these teeth uses the size-and-shape of the occlusal surface as a summary of the surface, deriving features from this, and then using these features in machine learning classification algorithms. Bovid teeth have previously been classified using this method with features derived from coefficients of elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA). This study assesses the utility of using other shape representations for feature generation, specifically elastics shape analysis. Features were derived using this frame work for both shape only and size-and-shape (i.e. size is not considered a nuisance parameter), and those features were used as input for machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate that features derived elastic shape analysis generally outperform features derived from EFA in terms of cross validation classification accuracy. Finally, an application of the classification methods studied here was applied to fossils recovered from the deroofed Gladysvale External deposit (GVED), Gauteng Province, South Africa. Previous analyses of GVED identified a group of bovids as medium sized alcelaphines (Lacruz et al., 2002). Specifically, this study reclassified 32 unbroken, medium sized alcelaphines looking at shape and size-and-shape. The reclassifications increased the number of individuals and diversity of bovids recovered from the site. The results were used to generate a more precise paleoenvironmental reconstruction.},

In this work, chert samples collected from a mining complex located in the Gargano promontory (Apulia, Italy) have been investigated by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) using a commercial handheld (h) LIBS instrument. In order to discriminate chert samples according to their mining site, the broadband LIBS spectra acquired on the specimens were subjected to multivariate data analysis. In particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms, including discriminant analysis (DA), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), were applied to the data set from the averaged LIBS spectra of each sample dimensionally reduced by principal components analysis (PCA). Among the classifiers tested, the highest accuracy (72.34\%) in identifying the chemical features of five different chert suites and discriminating their sources was achieved by Leave-OneOut Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) using the cosine KNN ML algorithm. The exclusion of PC1, which appeared to be mainly influenced by elements featuring large intra-class variation and engraved the clusterization, allowed to improve the accuracy of the classification reaching the value of 80.85\% using the linear DA algorithm. The classification and discrimination between 2 classes (1 x 1) reached a high rate of correct predictions, which implied that this discrimination could be used as a subsequent mean to confirm if the class predicted in the previously performed multiclass classification was correct. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that even chemically similar geological materials could be discriminated using LIBS analysis combined with appropriate multivariate chemometric data processing, in particular with the aim of recognizing and differentiating specific geological chert sources and identifying the origin of chert archaeological artifacts.},

	abstract = {Underwater archaeology is of great significance for historical and cultural transmission and preservation of underwater heritage, but it is also a challenging task. Underwater heritage is located in an environment with high sediment content, objects are mostly buried, and the water is turbid, resulting in some of the features of objects missing or blurred, making it difficult to accurately identify and understand the semantics of various objects in the scene. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a global enhancement network (GENet) underwater scene parsing method. We introduce adaptive dilated convolution by adding an extra regression layer, which can automatically deduce adaptive dilated coefficients according to the different scene objects. In addition, considering the easy confusion in the process of fuzzy feature classification, an enhancement classification network is proposed to increase the difference between various types of probabilities by reducing the loss function. We verified the validity of the proposed model by conducting numerous experiments on the Underwater Shipwreck Scenes (USS) dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm under three different conditions: conventional, relic semi-buried, and turbidified water quality. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs best in different situations. To verify the generalizability of the proposed algorithm, we conducted comparative experiments on the current publicly available Cityscapes, ADE20K, and the underwater dataset SUIM. The experimental results show that this paper achieves good performance on the public dataset, indicating that the proposed algorithm is generalizable.},

	abstract = {Distinguishing agents of bone modification at paleoanthropological sites is an important means of understanding early hominin evolution. Fracture pattern analysis is used to help determine site formation processes, including whether hominins were hunting or scavenging for animal food resources. Determination of how these behaviors manifested in ancient human sites has major implications for our biological and behavioral evolution, including social and cognitive abilities, dietary impacts of having access to in-bone nutrients like marrow, and cultural variation in butchering and food processing practices. Nevertheless, previous analyses remain inconclusive, often suffering from lack of replicability, misuse of mathematical methods, and/or failure to overcome equifinality. In this paper, we present a new approach aimed at distinguishing bone fragments resulting from hominin and carnivore breakage. Our analysis is founded on a large collection of scanned three-dimensional models of fragmentary bone broken by known agents, to which we apply state of the art machine learning algorithms. Our classification of fragments achieves an average mean accuracy of 77\% across tests, thus demonstrating notable, but not overwhelming, success for distinguishing the agent of breakage. We note that, while previous research applying such algorithms has claimed higher success rates, fundamental errors in the application of machine learning protocols suggest that the reported accuracies are unjustified and unreliable. The systematic, fully documented, and proper application of machine learning algorithms leads to an inherent reproducibility of our study, and therefore our methods hold great potential for deciphering when and where hominins first began exploiting marrow and meat, and clarifying their importance and influence on human evolution.},

	abstract = {External representations (ERs) are objects or performances in the world whose proper function is to communicate about other things in the world. Why and how did we make them, and what do they give us? We outline a simple framework for thinking about ERs grounded in modern machine learning. We propose a minimal set of neural mechanisms needed for open-ended ER production. Our constructivist enactive view contrasts with nativist views which propose specialist neural modules requiring symbolic internal representations. We propose a plausible set of (biological and cultural) evolutionary steps to full Gricean symbolic communication via a set of increasingly complex enactive algorithms for ER production. A pragmatic space of games is defined, which includes not only fully cooperative language games but also science, art, and evolved signal manipulation games. This space is defined by the complexity of learning needed by sender and receiver. We propose that one important step towards open-ended ER use was selection for bush reading, which like mind-reading is an inferential process requiring complex contextual and syntactic understanding of cues about events displaced in space and time. Bush reading pre-adapted receivers to be receptive, competent, and perspicacious interpreters of later intentionally produced signals about hidden topics such as felt mental states. This paved the way for minimally Gricean communication, which subsequently could be bootstrapped into explicit theories of mind, folk psychology narratives, and symbolic language in general. Recent findings in cognitive archaeology are integrated within the framework, and new experiments in machine learning suggested.},

	abstract = {Many square ancient sites exist in the Mongolian plateau region, and locating them is of great importance for archaeological research. In recent years, object detection in Google Earth (GE) high-resolution remote sensing (RS) images based on deep learning has driven archaeologists' research of ancient site detection. Deep learning techniques significantly improve the accuracy of site detection in RS images when compared with traditional detection methods while reducing design and computation time. Based on the characteristics of the research objectives, this paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm for the detection of square ancient sites in GE high-resolution RS images, which employs Swin-Transformer, VGG16, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) to form an improved backbone network, and three methods to optimize the Region Proposal Network (RPN). In addition, a dataset of known square ancient sites containing four typical regions of the Mongolian plateau is built using GE high-resolution RS images for training and evaluating the algorithm model. The experimental results show that the Precision, Recall, F1, IoU, and Average Precision (AP) of the proposed improved Faster R-CNN are 91.38\%, 91.16\%, 91.27\%, 83.49\%, and 93.57\%, respectively, which are 34.89\%, 2.70\%, 22.29\%, 31.46\%, and 7.32\% higher than those of the original Faster R-CNN. The algorithm also has high evaluation metrics for object detection in four typical regions: hills, Gobi, cropland, and grassland. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to detect square ancient sites in six selected typical regions, and numerous new ones are discovered. Overall, the proposed algorithm provides an effective method for archaeological investigations in the study region.
Deep learning is applied to Google Earth high-resolution RS images of the Mongolian Plateau for archaeological detection. A dataset of square ancient sites on typical regions of the Mongolian Plateau has been created. An improved Faster R-CNN algorithm is proposed by modifying the backbone network and the region proposal network. The proposed algorithm is used to detect square ancient sites in typical regions of the Mongolian plateau with good effects.},

I also claim that, in assuming this distributed, enactive, and non-representational stance on style as memory, it becomes evident that remembering is something we do: an active engagement that emerges with and through material culture in specific sociomaterial settings.},

Remote sensing using aerial photographs has been central to research in Bokoni since the 1970s. Through this, stone-walled structures of various shapes, sizes and functions have been identified. These include circular homesteads, agricultural terraces and stone-walled roads. This study employed machine learning - support vector machines (SVM) - to determine whether such structures can be automatically extracted from LiDAR data and classified using computerised techniques. In this paper, we present our innovative research on the use of machine learning applications for the detection of stone-walled structures in the Bokoni village of Khutwaneng, Thaba-Chweu, Mpumalanga Province. The results show that the total (overall) accuracy of the auto detection of stone-walled structures is 95\% and the Kappa coefficient (K) accuracy is 91\%, which is acceptable in terms of both overall and K accuracy.

Here, we examine how heritage science can, and to an extent has, moved beyond the straightforward scientific analysis of historical materials and artefacts through an exploration of heritage science's interactions with four key themes: (i) historical and archival research, (ii) conservation practice, (iii) policy at governmental, organisational and institutional levels, and (iv) a view to how new technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, can shape the future of heritage science. Much of the review narrative is framed via the analysis of UK-based case studies; however, they deal with issues that are international in nature (universal) and therefore transcend the UK context. Taken together, we demonstrate that heritage science as a discipline is capable of directly instigating or (re-)framing new areas or avenues of research, as well as enhancing and feeding into existing research questions, and has adapted and evolved along with emerging technologies and funding opportunities.},

The common multi-method approach is unable to discriminate between the two districts, and such distinction is only partially glimpsed using unsupervised multivariate data analyses on a transformed geochemical dataset of reference samples. In contrast, several supervised classification models have been successfully trained to discriminate between the quarries without any special data transformation. All the trained models agree to assign the three sets of archaeological samples to the Gualba quarry district.

The uniqueness of many of these pieces hinders their mineralogical analysis because the pieces cannot be damaged for sampling; therefore, errors in the classification of these materials are common. In the present study, we evaluate the suitability of the spectroradiometry technique in the analysis of two archaeological talc pieces. Both came from the Iron Age archaeological site of Pe \& ntilde;a del Castro (La Ercina, Le \& oacute;n) in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. We compared the spectral curves of these 2 pieces with the spectral curves from 50 talc geological samples from different geographical sources, combining bulk and powdered samples. Our results show that spectral curves enabled the identification of the talc material in the powdered and bulk samples. Moreover, the absence of the talc characteristic features in other soft materials also used in antiquity enabled the detection of incorrect identification of the classified pieces. Even though our results cannot be used to define any absorption feature characteristic to establish the provenance of the material, in the present study, spectral analysis has been shown to be suitable as a nondestructive technique to mineralogically identify archaeological pieces.},

However, the identification of these marks is still problematic in some localities on account of the similarities with the modifications generated by non-human processes, including biostratinomic and post-depositional bone surface modifications. Toll Cave (Barcelona, Spain), with chronologies between 47.310 BP and 69.800 BP, is one of the case studies where the cut-marks could easily be confused with abundant grooves generated by the dragging of sedimentary particles (e.g. trampling), but also with the scores produced by carnivores.

This methodological approach has allowed us to distinguish the bone surface modifications with 97.5\% reliability. We show the usefulness of this technique to help solve many taphonomic equifinality problems in the archaeological assemblages, as well as the need to implement new approaches to eliminate subjectivity in the descriptions of bone damage and make more accurate inferences about the past.},

	abstract = {Climate has played a significant role in shaping the distribution of mammal species across the world. Mammal community composition can therefore be used for inferring modern and past climatic conditions. Here, we develop a novel approach for bioclimatic inference using machine learning (ML) algorithms, which allows for accurate prediction of a set of climate variables based on the composition of the faunal community. The automated dataset construction process aggregates bioclimatic variables with modern species distribution maps, and includes multiple taxonomic ranks as explanatory variables for the predictions. This yields a large dataset that can be used to produce highly accurate predictions. Various ML algorithms that perform regression have been examined. To account for spatial dependence in our data, we employed a geographical block validation approach for model validation and selection. The random forest (RF) outperformed the other evaluated algorithms. Ultimately, we used unseen modern mammal surveys to assess the high predictive performances and extrapolation abilities achieved by our trained models. This contribution introduces a framework and methodology to construct models for developing models based on neo-ecological data, which could be utilized for paleoclimate applications in the future. The study aimed to satisfy specific criteria for interpreting both modern and paleo faunal assemblages, including the ability to generate reliable climate predictions from faunal lists with varying taxonomic resolutions, without the need for published wildlife inventory data from the study area. This method demonstrates the versatility of ML techniques in climate modeling and highlights their promising potential for applications in the fields of archaeology and paleontology.},

The author compares technologies of automated warfare (the Igloo White Operation, Predator and Reaper drones, Project Pigeon etc.) with the game to reveal that certain military aspects (automated tracking, killing, manhunt, mental manipulation etc.) recur in the software. The pleasure of playing games masks the military entrapment. The author explains how the software exploits the joys of being 'immersed' in a machine. The gameplay implements the cybernetic project of man-machine interaction, providing the player with an illusion of control. In reality, the AI system manages the player's behaviour and emotions, making them enjoy being preyed on.

	abstract = {Transmission muography is a non-invasive and non-destructive imaging method which allows to estimate the integrated density of a volume in a given direction (also referred as opacity). It is used in multiple societal applications like archaeology, nuclear safety or geoscience. It relies on the reconstruction of muon tracks that crossed the studied volume compared to the corresponding open sky expectation. The portable experimental setups developed by CEA/Irfu group operates four Micromegas gaseous detectors, HV and DAQ modules, and an embedded computer allowing remote control. Used Micromegas detectors have a multiplexed readout to optimize the DAQ system, while keeping good spatial resolution. However, the natural muon flux is relatively low, so muography images could have high levels of statistical noise, which would be propagated to the reconstructed 3D images. For this reason, we propose three new methods, using machine learning, which increase significantly the quality of 2D images and 3D tomographies. We developed a new demultiplexing method for the Micromegas. It showed its efficiency both for 1D and 2D multiplexed detectors, in a hodoscopic tracker and a Time Projection Chamber (TPC). In the TPC, this method can embed a particle identification between muon-hits and electron-hits. We demonstrated how neural networks could denoise muography images. In the context of the scanning of a nuclear reactor, we used data augmentation, modeling few hundreds fake nuclear reactors. Muographies from different points of view were simulated to train a denoising neural network. These new methods significantly improved the muography images. Nonetheless, the used 3D tomography algorithm still has some limitations. We proved that it was possible to build a 3D post-process neural network, which was trained to compensate the reconstruction algorithm's limitations.},

	abstract = {The analysis of three-dimensional point cloud data is becoming one of the most used approaches to assess instabilities processes affecting rock slopes. With the increased collection of point cloud data, there is an increasing demand for rapid computational point cloud segmentation techniques to format data for rock fall risk analysis. However, there is a scarcity of semantic segmentation research focusing on geological data and the practical issues they pose. In this study, we propose a novel application to automatically define the spatial extent and intensity of weathered rock slope areas. The studied rock slopes are in Hegra Archaeological Site (al-Hijr / Mada in Salih), the first UNESCO World Heritage area inscribed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2008. Here, cavernous weathering processes, with honeycombs and tafoni features, affect the carved rock slope and increase the rockfall hazard. With the spread and improvement of close-range methods, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Digital Photogrammetry (UAV-DP), it is possible to obtain fast and accurate high-resolution point cloud data of the studied scenario, i.e., rock mass. This paper presents the automated mapping results obtained by a combination of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms and threedimensional geometric analysis of a point cloud using the geometric feature tools available for free on CloudCompare (CC) open-source software. Three-dimensional data were obtained using the UAV-DP technique. The proposed workflow allows, using random forest modelling (RF), to quantify the cavernous weathering extent and estimate the relative intensity on the rock slope, faster than using traditional time-consuming manual segmentation processes. The RF model was able to accurately forecast the cavernous weathering regions (accuracy of up to 85\%), with a slight propensity to underpredict, as indicated by the somewhat low recall (similar to 63\%), and a limited number of false positives, as indicated by the high precision (up to 84\%). This approach is easily reproducible at low cost in terms of computational, human, and financial resources. The results highlight the reliability of the proposed method for the preliminary assessment of cavernous erosional features with the aim of future assessment, monitoring, and deeper analysis of rock-carved slopes.},

Crowdsourcing scales better than direct digitisation by experts, but requires an appropriate platform and the technical skills to adapt it. Existing research provides little guidance as to when investments in these approaches become worthwhile. Here we present a customisation of the Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS) Mobile platform tailored to offer a streamlined, collaborative system for crowdsourcing map digitisation by volunteers with no prior GIS experience. Deployed in Bulgaria as an ancillary activity during 2017-2018 archaeological fieldwork, FAIMS Mobile was used to digitise 10,827 mound features from Soviet military topographic maps. This digitisation required 241 person-hours (57 from staff; 184 from novice volunteers), with an error rate under 6\%. The resulting dataset was consistent, well -documented, and ready for analysis with a few hours of processing. A conservative estimate based on our work suggests our crowdsourcing approach is most efficient for digitisation projects of 10,000-60,000 features, but may offer advantages for datasets as small as a few hundred records. Furthermore, it indicates that systems designed for field data collection, running on mobile devices, can be profitably customised to serve as partici-patory geospatial data systems accessible to novice volunteers.},

We present results that demonstrate the accuracy, precision, and recall of our approach. Results show that optical UAV data can be an easy way for authorities to monitor heritage sites, demonstrating the utility of deep learning in aiding the protection of heritage sites by automating the detection of any new damage to sites.

Therefore, we now have empirical data on the nature of an unexcavated settlement.

From the archaeological excavation it is possible to confirm with a very high degree of probability that part of the ancient settlement still survives on the shaded side of the hill and can be extensively excavated becoming a first-rate heritage reference of high social value in the future. If future urban planning in the area follows the steps that are now being taken, we will have a relevant archaeological asset to learn about the end of the Iberian world with the arrival of Rome.
The ceramic record is a document of unquestionable value for archaeology when we try to approach the knowledge of protohistoric societies.

	abstract = {Alluvial floodplains were one of the major venues of the development and long-term transformation of urban agrarian-based societies. The historical relationship between human societies and riverine environments created a rich archaeological record, but it is one that is not always easy to access due to the dynamism of alluvial floodplains and the geomorphological processes driven their hydrological regimes. Alluvial floodplains are also targeted for urban and agricultural expansion, which both have the potential to pose threats to cultural heritage and the environment if not carefully managed. Analysis that combines Historical Cartography and Remote Sensing sources to identify potential archaeological sites and river palaeochannels is an important first step towards the reconstruction of settlement patterns in different historical periods and their relationship to the history of hydrological networks. We are able to use different computational methods to great effect, including algorithms to enhance the visualization of different features of the landscape; and for processing large quantity of data using Machine-Learning based methods. Here we integrate those methods for the first time in a single study case: a section of the Indus River basin. Using a combined approach, it has been possible to map the historical hydrological network in a detail never achieved before and identify hundreds of potential archaeological sites previously unknown. Discussing these datasets together, we address the interpretation of the archaeological record, and highlight how Remote Sensing approaches can inform future research, heritage documentation, management, and preservation. The paper concludes with a targeted analysis of our datasets in the light of previous field-based research in order to provide preliminary insights on how long-term processes might have re-worked historical landscapes and their potential implications for the study of settlement patterns in different Historical periods in this region, thereby highlighting the potential for such integrated approaches.},

The field of nuclear industrial archaeology specialises in finding and characterising these sites to support local communities and site owners.

	abstract = {Identifying the age of ancient bronze vessels requires many relevant historical materials, takes a long time, and has strong subjectivity. We propose a new approach to assist archaeologists in analyzing and dating ancient bronze artifacts. The proposed method applies deep learning methods for age discrimination of ancient bronze artifacts based on image classification pre training weights. First, through multiple basic experiments, EfficientNetV2-L with good discrimination results is selected as the baseline model from four representative network models. Thereafter, EfficientNetV2-L is used to extract features from the ancient bronze ware dataset, and then, the original linear classification layer is replaced with cosin\_classifier to reduce the risk caused by variance and improve the model's discrimination ability. Finally, the focal loss function is introduced to replace the original cross entropy loss function for loss calculation. Under the influence of the focusing parameter and class weighting factor, the poor model learning performance caused by a small number of samples and categories is effectively reduced. The proposed method improves the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve by 4. 1 percentage points, 4. 0 percentage points, 4. 1 percentage points, 4. 2 percentage points, and 0. 9 percentage points,respectively, compared to the original EfficientNetV2-L, achieving an optimal accuracy of 91. 7\% on the test set. Additionally, a model prediction analysis is conducted on controversial bronze artifacts with different stages. The results indicate that deep learning technology is effective in identifying the age of ancient bronze ware datasets, providing reference analysis data and reducing the workload of archaeological experts.},

	abstract = {The region of present-day Angola was one of the main areas from which millions of enslaved Africans were abducted and forced to migrate to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade. Strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis is a useful tool in reconstructing large-scale human movements across geologically distinct landscapes in archaeological and forensic contexts. However, the absence of environmental 87Sr/86Sr reference data from Angola hinders the use of 87Sr/86Sr analysis in provenance studies related to Angola, especially in identifying the geographic origin of enslaved people in the African Diaspora. Here, we measured 101 plant samples from most, yet not all, major geological units to draft the first bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr map (isoscape) for Angola using a machine learning framework. Our results suggest that the 87Sr/86Sr ratios in Angola span a large range from 0.70679 to 0.76815 between the different geological units. Specifically, the high average 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.74097 (+/- 0.00938, 1 SD) found in the Angola Block of central Angola, are distinctly more radiogenic than any previously published bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for western Central and West Africa. However, these match the 87Sr/86Sr ratios previously published for human enamel samples from four historic slavery contexts in the Americas. We demonstrate that our strontium isoscape of Angola greatly improves the ability to assess the possible origins of enslaved African individuals discovered outside of Africa and encourage the future use of emerging African isoscapes in the study of life histories within the slave trade.},

To deal with this problem, we investigated the possibility of using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) to predict archaeological and non-archaeological features. The chosen study area was previously occupied by farming communities and is characterised by natural soils (non-sites), vitrified dung, non-vitrified dung, and savannah woody vegetation. The study uses a three-stage GEOBIA that comprises (1) image object segmentation, (2) feature selection, and (3) object classification. The spectral mean of each band and the area extent of an object were selected as input variables for object classifications in support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The results of this study have shown that GEOBIA approaches have the potential to map archaeological landscapes. The SVM and RF classifiers achieved high classification accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.87\%, respectively. Visual inspection of the classified images has demonstrated the importance of the aforementioned models in mapping archaeological and non-archaeological features because of their ability to manage the spectral confusion between non-sites and vitrified dung sites. In summary, the results have demonstrated that the GEOBIAs ability to incorporate spatial elements in the classification model ameliorates the chances of distinguishing materials with limited spectral differences.},

Early archaeologists had an interest in identifying ways of playing the games of antiquity, and they applied diffusionist models fashionable at the time to trace the development of games from antiquity to the games played in nine-teenth century Europe and North America. In time, a huge amount of data on ancient games was collected, and in the last thirty years archaeologists have studied games as they relate to social processes. In parallel to this, artificial intelligence (AI) research has utilized board games, primarily as testbeds for developing AI techniques, but also as an application domain. Archaeological and AI methods are combined in the Digital Ludeme Project, which documents the preserved knowledge of ancient games and uses computational techniques to evaluate research questions that can be addressed through AI playouts of proposed rulesets for games.},

	abstract = {Phytoliths constitute microscopic SiO2-rich biominerals formed in the cellular system of many living plants and are often preserved in soils, sediments and artefacts. Their analysis contributes significantly to the identification and study of botanical remains in (paleo)ecological and archaeological contexts. Traditional identification and classification of phytoliths rely on human experience, and as such, an emerging challenge is to automatically classify them to enhance data homogeneity among researchers worldwide and facilitate reliable comparisons. In the present study, a deep artificial neural network (NN) is implemented under the objective to detect and classify phytoliths, extracted from modern wheat (Triticum spp.). The proposed methodology is able to recognise four phytolith morphotypes: (a) Stoma, (b) Rondel, (c) Papillate, and (d) Elongate dendritic. For the learning process, a dataset of phytolith photomicrographs was created and allocated to training, validation and testing data groups. Due to the limited size and low diversity of the dataset, an end-to-end encoder-decoder NN architecture is proposed, based on a pre-trained MobileNetV2, utilised for the encoder part and U-net, used for the segmentation stage. After the parameterisation, training and fine-tuning of the proposed architecture, it is capable to classify and localise the four classes of phytoliths in unknown images with high unbiased accuracy, exceeding 90\%. The proposed methodology and corresponding dataset are quite promising for building up the capacity of phytolith classification within unfamiliar (geo)archaeological datasets, demonstrating remarkable potential towards automatic phytolith analysis.},

In order to determine patterns within the assemblage of 208,493 plant items from 123 archaeological contexts, we applied a novel approach to multivariate statistical analyses, making use of machine learning methods. A combination of cluster analysis and evolutionary decision trees out-performed traditional correspondence analysis and principal components analysis techniques, allowing for the discovery that whilst the assemblage was generally homogeneous, it was possible to identify certain types of deposits as being locations of plant "waste" disposal. The analysis also allowed identification of possible storage of barley and flax processing in one room, and some fireplaces in which the inhabitants chose to burn specific selected materials.},

	abstract = {Species identification of archaeofaunal remains can be informative of changing local and global ecosystems, as well as how we interacted with them in the past. However, with the vast majority of assemblages being domi-nated by morphologically indeterminate specimens, methods of biomolecular species identification are becoming more popular, such as the protein fingerprint-based identification approach known as ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry). As larger datasets are being produced, Machine Learning techniques such as those using Random Forest algorithms have been considered to expedite the identification process. However, it has proven difficult to extract meaningful biomarkers from these processes alone and so far only tackled for mammals. Here, we introduce a novel approach based on the principles of the ID3 algorithm for biomarker identification from ZooMS spectral databases, focussing on archaeological fish remains from Europe and the Caribbean. We show that the tool is highly effective at generating comprehensible lists of family-and genus-level biomarkers. At family-level identification, the average sensitivity across five families of fish was-0.9, where a specificity of 1 would indicate a greatly effective algorithm that outperforms both traditional Random Forest and Naive Bayes approaches; at the genus level the mean sensitivity reduced to-0.8 across the nine genera tested. However, some anomalous matches were produced, with accuracy dropping when distinguishing between genera of the same family, such as Epinephelus and Mycteroperca belonging to the Serranidae. Therefore, while this tool has value in rapidly producing lists of biomarkers and can efficaciously identify new ZooMS fingerprints based on those markers, it indicates that manual intervention remains a requirement at finer taxonomic resolutions.},

This was done using Python and artificial intelligence-related computer programs. The result showed that the number of colors was nine with wavelengths of (613.48, 611.37, 594.01, 587.1, 599.42, 497.42, 603.03, 481.94, and 566.33) nm.

They helped in the identify the artist and the period. Additionally, in the event of a change in color during the preservation intervention was made, and the environment provided was suitable. The study was conducted on a private oil painting representing impressionism in Europe. It was found that the painting suffered from many aspects of deterioration. XRDFTIR-Raman (SEM-EDX) analysis showed the use of iron oxide in skin color, zinc oxide additives to obtain color gradations, and chromium green mixed with a small percentage of ground green to obtain gradations in the hilly area of the painting. FTIR and Raman analysis showed that the medium used was linseed oil. Furthermore, the microscopy and stereomicroscope examination of the cross-section showed the cross-sectional structure, the number of imaging layers, and several aspects of damage. Thus, an archival record was produced for future monitoring to prioritize treatment aspects, develop a current pre-treatment record, determine the treatment needed, and provide information on the treatment materials and methods used.},

The scientific promise of these data to expand our understanding of past human-environment interactions has not been fully realized. Limitations of data access, sufficient analytical and computational resources, and methodological awareness and education on the appropriate use of RSBD have limited the adoption and widespread use of RSBD in archaeology, despite its ubiquity in the Earth sciences. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a freely available planetary-scale cloud computing platform that addresses the perennial challenges of data access, analysis, and computing power that are particularly acute among archaeologists aiming to derive insights from RSBD. GEE lowers the barrier to entry for analyzing RSBD, expanding the potential for these data in the automated identification of archaeological features through deep learning; fieldwork planning and archaeological practice; modeling of past environments and environmental variability; and cultural heritage impact and risk assessments. In doing so, it also contributes to open science via increased access, transparency, and reproducibility.},

However, manual analysis by experts requires a significant time and money investment. This paper describes a deep learning model developed to segment, i.e., label, the semantics of objects of interest as a means to augment or supplant manual labeling of LiDAR data. The U-Net deep learning model forms the backbone of the system which has shown success in providing accurate outputs on similar LiDAR data set. The trained U-Net model is integrated into an inference pipeline to transform expansive LiDAR datasets into labeled output images. Work focuses on the classification of two semantic types: (1) platforms and (2) annular structures whose attributes, e.g., location, shape, and distribution, play an important role in improving our understanding of ancient Maya civilizations. This article provides a deep learning-based system that efficiently extracted these structures. CNN-generated inferences were compared against expert-labeled features to measure algorithm performance. Results for a LiDAR survey of 479 sq. km. indicate that the CNN provides an IoU performance of 0.82 and 0.74 for annular structures and platforms respectively. The discussion further analyzes how IoU performance relates to the viability of this approach as an aid or substitute for manual labeling.},

Sex recognition can be very challenging if the cadaver is exposed to extreme temperature and/or pressure. As the hardest part of the body, tooth remains can be useful in such circumstances. In this report, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment for rapid recognition and classification of human sexuality from their tooth using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) combined with machine learning algorithms. LIBS experiment was performed on the enamel part of the tooth samples of males and females. LIBS spectra of male and female teeth have shown a higher degree of similarity owing to the same chemical structure. Three machine learning algorithms including principal component analysis, artificial neural network, and logistic regression were used for their identification. The higher identification rates enable the strong possibility of human sex recognition from their teeth LIBS spectra. Further, a judicious feature selection approach was implemented to significantly reduce the data size to achieve maximum accuracy with minimal time. Finally, Student's t-test was applied with a 95\% confidence level to both the datasets to identify the most relevant features. Our findings demonstrate that the LIBS coupled with machine learning can be used as a productive and handy tool for fast and accurate recognition of human sex/gender from their teeth samples in forensic odontology and archaeology practice.},

This work is the first application of deep learning object detection methods to identify moated sites from time series satellite images. We presented multi-information fusion data (N-RGB) based on the fusion of multispectral and vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 time series imagery, generated a dataset of moated sites via the data augmentation method, and improved the YOLOv5s model by adding bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) structures for automatically identifying moated sites. The results indicate that the model trained with time series N-RGB data improves precision, recall, and mAP by more than 20.0\% compared with single image data. The improved model was able to enhance the identification of small, moated sites and achieved 100\% detection in a test of 100 moated sites. Ultimately, , 629 targets were detected in northeast Thailand, with a false-negative rate of less than 3\%, and 116 probable sites were identified. Among these, 6 probable sites were highly likely to be moated sites, as visually verified by high-resolution GEE imagery. In addition, , among the targets automatically detected in other regions of continental Southeast Asia, the 5, 3, 2, 1, and 7 most probable sites were identified in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and other regions of Thailand, respectively. In summary, , our approach enables the automatic detection of exposed and visible moated sites from satellite imagery, and could improve site discovery and documentation capabilities, opening new perspectives in larger geographic site units and even in civilization surveys.},

	abstract = {The study of material culture, particularly ceramics, is an important aspect of archaeology. The classification and typology of ceramics is often a key focus, with traditional methods based on the observation of specific morphological characteristics and the creation of taxonomies based on these types. However, recent advances in digital technologies and the use of Machine Learning have led to the development of new, digital approaches to ceramic classification. These approaches rely on statistical methods and computer science techniques to quantify vessel morphology and create multivariate datasets. The aim of this study is to compare a traditional approach elaborated by Renato Peroni and applied by many of his students, especially in the field of Italian protohistory, with a proposed digital method of ceramic classification. The comparison will be conducted using a database of approximately 1400 records from several Italian Bronze and Iron Age funerary contexts, including Casinalbo and other contexts in the Po Valley and northern Italy, as well as Pianello di Genga and Torre Galli. The proposed digital approach involves a combination of a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm and density -based clustering for the automated classification of ceramics. The study will consider the similarities and differences between the two methods and the potential for combining them in a complementary manner. The results of the study will provide a deeper understanding of traditional typologies and explore the potential for digital methods to enhance, improve, and complement them.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to show the application of a Deep Learning algorithm able to operate the segmentation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs present in an image, with the ambition to be as versatile as possible despite the variability of the image source. The problem is quite complex, the main obstacles being the considerable amount of different classes of existing hieroglyphs, the differences related to the hand of the scribe as well as the great differences among the various supports, such as papyri, stone or wood, where they are written. Furthermore, as in all archaeological finds, damage to the supports are frequent, with the consequence that hieroglyphs can be partially corrupted. In order to face this challenging problem, we leverage on the well-known Detectron2 platform, developed by the Facebook AI Research Group, focusing on the Mask R-CNN architecture to perform segmentation of image instances. Likewise, for several machine learning studies, one of the hardest challenges is the creation of a suitable dataset. In this paper, we will describe a hieroglyph dataset that has been created for the purpose of segmentation, highlighting its pros and cons, and the impact of different hyperparameters on the final results. Tests on the segmentation of images taken from public databases will also be presented and discussed along with the limitations of our study.},

This has been a foundational task in modern archeological studies. Due to the development of deep neural networks(DNNs) in computer vision, detecting OBIs can be implemented by a more concise method instead of designing complicated hand-crafted features. However, existing models cannot perform well when noise areas are similar to some inscriptions. In this work, we present a simple but effective pseudo-label-based architecture for OBIs detection. Different from previous approaches, our method performs OBIs detection with the employment of information from multilabel annotations rather than single location information. We append a plug-and-play module that predicts the pseudo-label of an inscription after the backbone network for learning the particular structure prior to each inscription and brings this information to the backbone network by means of feature fusion. We make remarkable improvements on different backbone networks when using the proposed method on an OBIs detection dataset. The quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model can detect OBIs well and is an effective tool for assisting in the discovery and recognition of ancient writing.},

This methodological approach is suitable for the identification and accurate location of ancient mines and hydrologic infrastructure, providing new tools for accurate mapping of mining landforms.

Since ancient knappers struggled to remove it from activity areas, its presence can reveal stone tool production and maintenance, as well as site-formation processes. So far, scholars have examined soil samples under a microscope. More angular forms, higher transparency, and other characteristics set microdebitage apart from other soil particles. While intuitive, this definition is subjective and difficult to apply consistently. In our alternative approach, we combine experimental archaeology with dynamic image analysis, statistics, and machine learning. A modern stone knapper who uses traditional raw materials and tools produced 101,298 microdebitage flakes. We compare 38,787 chert and 62,511 obsidian flakes with 23,980 sand and gravel particles. A dynamic image particle analyzer measured each of the 125,278 particles. We discuss seven variables as proxies for Fladmark's definition of microdebitage. Since they distribute non-normally, we use non-parametric statistical tests to show that microdebitage differs highly significantly from sand and gravel for all seven proxies. Particle-specific data allow us to quantify microdebitage characteristics, propose 0.5-4 mm as size limits, and discuss the robustness of our definition. We conclude that our approach enables an objective analysis of microdebitage.},

Furthermore, quantitative analysis with 2D techniques would facilitate the standardization of the terms used to discriminate and describe the different types of polish.The Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix is a 2D image analysis technique that provides quantitative data on image texture. Although quite common in other research field, this technique has not been systematically applied in the archaeological research. Unlike other quantitative approaches this technique takes little time and has no cost, as it uses traditional 2D images. Futhermore, this method acts as a bridge between qualitative and quan-titative analyses. In this first approach, four use-wear traces (unused, butchering, shell, wood, antler) on flint experimental samples were analysed with selections of square images of 300x300 and 600x600 pixels (30 for each contact material).This technique together with a learning algorithm called Support Vector Machine has proved effective in distinguishing and quantifying four types of use-wear traces.},

However, these materials can undergo multiple post-depositional alterations after their introduction into the archaeological record.

The present study examines the use of gray level images to obtain quantitative data from the surface of flint artifacts and determine whether these images can detect the presence of post-depositional alterations. An experimental collection of flints was subjected to sequential episodes of rounding in a tumbling machine. After each episode, photographs were taken with a microscope, resulting in quantitative surface values using gray level values. The quantitative surface values were used as variables in machine learning models to determine time of exposure and the most salient variables for discrimination. Our results indicate that the extraction of metrics from gray level images successfully capture changes in the surface of flint artifacts caused by post-depositional processes. Additional results provide insight into which areas to sample when seeking post-depositional alterations and underscore the importance of particle size in the generation of alterations.},

	abstract = {In this quickly developing world, automatic currency identification and recognition are crucial tasks. Several financial institutions, such as banks and hardware-based devices such as vending machines and slot machines, play an essential role in all monetary unification fields. Accurate coin recognition is essential in various contexts, including vending machines, currency exchange, and archaeological research. However, the distinctive visual characteristics of Brazilian coins, including variations in size, color, and design, pose significant challenges for automated classification. Most of the existing currency recognition systems are based on the physical properties of the currencies, such as length, breadth, and mass. At the same time, image-based methods rely on other properties like color, shape, and edge. This paper presents a novel deep-learning framework tailored to classify Brazilian coins. Our proposed deep learning framework leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address these challenges. We introduce a Repetitive Feature Extractor Convolution Neural Network (RFE-CNN) model to recognize the currency faster and accurately. Our framework employs a multi-stage approach for coin classification. First, a pre-processing module handles coin localization and image enhancement to mitigate variations in lighting and background. Next, an RFE-CNN-based feature extractor extracts discriminative features from the coin images. We explore transfer learning from pre-trained models to enhance the model's generalization capability, given limited data availability. We used a comprehensive dataset of Brazilian coins, comprising various denominations, minting years, and conditions, to facilitate model training and evaluation. The dataset includes high-resolution images captured under diverse lighting and environmental conditions, ensuring robust model performance in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, our proposed deep learning framework offers a powerful and efficient solution for classifying Brazilian coins. The framework's adaptability makes it a valuable tool for recognizing coins from other regions with similar visual diversity and variability challenges. The proposed model has achieved a classification accuracy of 98.34\% for the classification of Brazilian coins.},

	abstract = {The use of seaweed as fuel has been mentioned in ethnographic and historical sources of different coastal regions. Nevertheless, the archaeological record of seaweed burning is still limited to contexts where preservation is exceptional and macroscopic discrimination of charred remains is possible. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in discriminating seaweed vs. plant/wood char. Our dataset (N = 92) consists of modern and archaeological seaweed and plant/wood charred remains, including specimens of unknown origin from the Atacama Desert coast, Northern Chile. The charred samples were processed to obtain 13 parameters which were then fed into five supervised machine learning models. The models, built on samples of known origin (seaweed and plant/wood), performed remarkably well in terms of accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. The models were used for final predictions on 10 non-identified archaeological charcoals. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques is a robust methodology for discriminating seaweed and plant/wood charred remains in the archaeological record. The predictions on unknown samples confirm that seaweed was used as fuel in a specific funerary ritual in the southern Atacama Desert coast around 5000 cal BP. Furthermore, charred specimens of Lessonia spp. recovered from combustion features in other northern Chile coastal settlements, suggest that seaweed pyrotechnology developed by Atacama Desert coast people is likely a long-term process. As for coastal archaeology, this work encourages new research on seaweed as an alternative/main fuel in coastal deserts and evaluates possible bias for chronologies from coastal archaeological settlements around the globe.},

This study employs a cutting-edge machine learning approach to predict the suitability of archaeological sites in the region, marking a significant evolution in the documentation of such sites. Machine learning-based integration of 12 geoenvironmental datasets using a random forest model reveals a nuanced spatial distribution of potential archaeological sites, categorised into four suitability zones: high, moderately high, moderately low, and low. The region with the best-anticipated suitability comprises around 20.33\% of the research area, whereas the area with the lowest expected suitability comprises nearly 41.81\%. High suitability zones, characterised by gentle terrain, open vegetation, fertile soils, and water proximity, suggest conditions conducive to human habitation and archaeological preservation. Conversely, low suitability zones exhibit rugged terrain, dense vegetation, poor soil quality, limited water availability, and remoteness from natural resources, indicating potential hindrances to human occupation and archaeological preservation. The model exhibited high predictive accuracy, as evidenced by the ROC-AUC score of 88.3\%, enhancing its reliability. Specific locations within the study area demonstrate varying degrees of suitability, providing valuable insights for archaeological site management, cultural heritage preservation, and land-use planning, which will support the restoration and conservation plan of the heritage sites.

Next steps towards making a more robust version of this model include the addition of more training data and integration of a larger number of morphologic parameters. Based on the results described here as well as those in cited works focused on caves, we proposed machine learning as a first step in cave and cave-like feature identification, followed then by fieldwork and ground-truthing.},

Using a methodology based on media archeology, the origins of the machine condition will be reviewed in relation to the processes of creative expression in the context of media art by paying special attention to procedural art as the culmination of non-human art. A comparative analysis will be carried out of a corpus formed by two representative manifestos of the limits and possibilities of the creative alliance of humans and machines in the last century: "L'arte meccanica. Manifesto futurista" (1923) and "The Decentralized Unicist Manifesto" (2021), resulting from the employment of AI to the field of art through machine learning and neural networks. From this study, the pioneering role of this type of programmatic texts will be evaluated to define the relationship between creativity and posthumanism from two historical moments marked by the collective urgency in identifying the risks and benefits that exist in the artistic use of autonomous intelligence systems.},

	abstract = {Material characteristics of casting moulds are crucial for understanding the evolution and diversification of bronze ritual vessel production in Bronze Age China. During relevant studies, a Back Scattered Electron (BSE) image detector is commonly employed to analyze mould microstructure, effectively revealing the volume ratios and shape features of the clay matrix, silt/sand particles, and voids. It is always challenging to analyze and cross- compare these BSE images quantitatively since they typically contain numerous phases with highly irregular shapes. Traditionally, time consuming manual point counting or multi-step image processing were used to obtain semi-quantitative results. Addressing these challenges, we have proposed a deep learning method called BCMSegNet, an optimized Mask R-CNN-based algorithm for segmenting BSE images of bronze casting moulds and cores. Using the proposed method, key parameters, such as area, Feret diameter, roundness, and solidity of segmented particles, can be provided based on well segmented results, even for the images with complex background. Experimental outcomes show that the algorithm achieves a segmentation precision of 95\% and an accuracy of around 91\%, demonstrating its strong generalization capability. This study provides a significant foundation for micro-feature analysis of archaeological ceramic materials, classification of particles, and determination of technological processes in archaeological research.},

Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.},

	abstract = {The detection of subsurface archaeological remains using a range of remote sensing methods poses several challenges. Recent studies regarding the detection of archaeological proxies like those of cropmarks highlight the complexity of the phenomenon. In this work, we present three different methods, and associated indices, for identifying stressed reflectance signatures indicating buried archaeological remains, based on a dataset of measured ground spectroradiometric reflectance. Several spectral profiles between the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum were taken in a controlled environment in Cyprus during 2011-2012 and are re-used in this study. The first two (spectral) methods are based on a suitable analysis of the spectral signatures in (1) the visible part of the spectrum, in particular in the neighborhood of 570 nm, and (2) the red edge part of the spectrum, in the neighborhood of 730 nm. Machine learning (decision trees) allows for the deduction of suitable wavelengths to focus on in order to formulate the proposed indices and the associated classification criteria (decision boundaries) that can enhance the detection probability of stressed vegetation. Noise in the signal is taken into account by simulating reflectance signatures perturbed by white noise. Applying decision tree classification on the ensemble of simulations and basic statistical analysis, we refine the formulation of the indices and criteria for the noisy signatures. The success rate of the proposed methods is over 90\%. The third method rests on the estimation of vegetation/canopy reflectance parameters through inversion of the physical-based PROSAIL reflectance model and the associated classification through machine learning methods. The obtained results provide further insights into the formation of stress vegetation that occurred due to the presence of shallow buried archaeological remains, which are well aligned with physical-based models and existing empirical knowledge. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the usefulness of radiative transfer models such as PROSAIL for understanding the formation of cropmarks. Similar studies can support future research directions towards the development of regional remote sensing methods and algorithms if systematic observations are adequately dispersed in space and time.},

	abstract = {Underwater photogrammetry is often hampered by chromatic aberration, leading to degraded 2D and 3D products. This study investigates the effectiveness of various color enhancement methods in addressing these challenges.
Theoretical considerations indicate that light penetration depth varies inversely with wavelength, causing underwater images to exhibit a blue or green cast with increasing depth. Color enhancement techniques can restore natural colors by compensating for this spectral attenuation. Additionally, scattering, caused by light reflected by particles in the water, can introduce haze into underwater images. Color enhancement can mitigate scatter and improve image clarity. In this contribution, to quantitatively evaluate color enhancement methods, we compare original images with images processed using gray-world assumption methods and physical methods that account for the physical properties of light underwater. Using artificial intelligence (AI) for underwater image color enhancement, a data-driven approach was also employed. These methods were applied to a case study concerning a Roman Navis Lapidaria shipwreck carrying five monumental cipollino marble columns at a depth of 4.5 meters in the Porto Cesareo Marine Protected Area (Italy). These methods were compared quantitatively and qualitatively, and the results are presented and discussed.},

One of its biggest problems is that over the years the nature of the materials used in the creation of the artwork make them prone to cracks, fractures, stains, and colors fading and blurring. The causes of their damage could be of natural or human- related reasons. The natural causes range from war, fires, earthquakes, natural disasters and the human-related causes range from accidental events like to pollution which results of climate changes, which like acid rain. It is a must to consider the environment in which you store your artwork. Our regular environment's light, heat, moisture, and pollution levels can lead to harmful chemical and physical reactions in artwork. There are several reasons why it is necessary to preserve ancient works of art. The fact that it enables us to comprehend the historical and cultural context of the era in which it was made is one of the key factors. Then preserving our artworks is a must and this can be done by manual techniques or using machine learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Traditional GIS-based statistical models are intended to extrapolate patterns of settlements and their interactions with the environment. They contribute significantly to our knowledge of past human-land relationships. Yet, these models are often criticized for their empiricism, lopsided specific factors, and for overlooking the synergy between variables. Though largely untested, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods have the potential to overcome these shortcomings comprehensively and objectively. The northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) is characterized by diverse environments and significant changes to the social system from the Neolithic to Bronze Age. In this study, this area serves as a representative case for assessing the complex relationships between settlement locations and geographic environments, taking full advantages of these new models. We have explored a novel modeling case by employing GIS and random forests to consider multiple factors, including terrain, vegetation, soil, climate, hydrology, and land suitability, to construct classification models identifying environmental variation across different cultural periods. The model exhibited strong performance and a high archaeological prediction value. Potential living maps were generated for each cultural stage, revealing distinct environmental selection strategies from the Neolithic to Bronze Age. The key environmental parameters of elevation, climate, soil erosion, and cultivated land suitability were calculated with high weights, influencing human environmental decisions synergistically. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative analysis of temporal dynamics in climate and subsistence to understand driving mechanisms behind environmental strategies. These findings suggest that past human environmental strategies were based on the comprehensive consideration of various factors, coupled with their social economic scenario. Such subsistence-oriented activities supported human beings in overcoming elevation limitation, and thus allowed them to inhabit wider pastoral areas. This study showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting archaeological probabilities and in interpreting the environmental influence on settlement patterns.},

	abstract = {The systematic mapping of hollow roads, traces of (post)medieval sunken cart tracks ways, can provide information on past human movement and historical route networks. However, the sheer amount of traces and of available high-quality data necessitates the use of computational methods for the automatic detection of these archaeological objects. Therefore, a novel approach, named CarcassonNet, has been developed that uses a combination of a Deep Learning convolutional neural network and image processing algorithms to detect and trace hollow roads in LiDAR data from the Netherlands. CarcassonNet has been specifically developed for the archaeological domain, focusing on being computationally light and suited for reconstructing partially preserved and intersected hollow roads. Instead of using the whole roads as input for the convolutional neural network, in CarcassonNet individual sections are used. This makes it much more cost-effective to create a sufficient training dataset, and makes the classification task (performed by the neural network) relatively simple, with better detection results. The output of CarcassonNet consists of two types of geospatial vectors that offer the opportunity to efficiently study the roads themselves and their precise location in the landscape (polygons), and the course of the roads and the resulting route network (lines). An experimental evaluation shows that CarcassonNet is able to effectively detect hollow roads, with a MCC score of 0.47. Furthermore, it is shown that using the Digital Terrain Model, instead of visualized LiDAR data (hillshade) improves the performance of the convolutional neural network. The results of this research offer opportunities to reconstruct vanished and abandoned (post)medieval routes and answer questions about human-landscape interactions. (C) 2020 L'Auteur(s).

As shooting distance is among the main factors  behind shotgun patterning, this proof-of-concept study aimed to explore the  potential of neural net architectures to correctly classify shotgun pattern  images in terms of shooting distance. The study material comprised a total of 106  shotgun pattern images from two discrete shooting distances (n = 54 images from  10 m and n = 52 images from 17.5 m) recorded on blank white paper. The dataset  was used to train, validate and test deep learning algorithms to correctly  classify images in terms of shooting distance. The open source AIDeveloper  software was used for the deep learning procedure. In this dataset, a  TinyResNet-based algorithm reached the highest testing accuracy of 94\%. Of the  testing set, the algorithm classified all 10 m patterns correctly, and  misclassified one 17.5 m pattern. On the basis of these preliminary data, it  seems achievable to develop algorithms that would serve as a beneficial tool for  forensic investigators when estimating shooting distances from shotgun patterns.  In the future, studies with larger and more complex datasets are needed to  develop robust and applicable algorithms for forensic shotgun pattern  interpretation.},

Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6  million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with  which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the  combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers  may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial  intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of  an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at  Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of  hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some  early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore  guilds.},

Here, we present a major methodological breakthrough that incorporates these three elements using Artificial Intelligence (AI) through computer vision techniques, based on convolutional neural networks. This method, when applied to controlled experimental marks on bones, yielded the highest rate documented to date of accurate classification (92\%) of cut, tooth and trampling marks. After testing this method experimentally, it was applied to published images of some important traces purportedly indicating a very ancient hominin presence in Africa, America and Europe. The preliminary results are supportive of interpretations of ancient butchery in some places, but not in others, and suggest that new analyses of these controversial marks should be done following the protocol described here to confirm or disprove these archaeological interpretations.},

Crucial evolutionary features, such as the origin of stone tool use,  meat-eating, food-sharing, cooperation and sociality can only be addressed  through confident identification and interpretation of BSM, and more  specifically, cut marks. Recently, it has been argued that linear marks with the  same properties as cut marks can be created by crocodiles, thereby questioning  whether secure cut mark identifications can be made in the Early Pleistocene  fossil record. Powerful classification methods based on multivariate statistics  and machine learning (ML) algorithms have previously successfully discriminated  cut marks from most other potentially confounding BSM. However, crocodile-made  marks were marginal to or played no role in these comparative analyses. Here, for  the first time, we apply state-of-the-art ML methods on crocodile linear BSM and  experimental butchery cut marks, showing that the combination of multivariate  taphonomy and ML methods provides accurate identification of BSM, including cut  and crocodile bite marks. This enables empirically-supported hominin behavioural  modelling, provided that these methods are applied to fossil assemblages.},

Claims of an older human presence in the continent have been made based on the proposed anthropogenic modification of faunal remains; however, these have been controversial due to the highly subjective nature of the interpretations. Here, we employ advanced deep learning algorithms to objectively increase the accuracy of BSM identification on bones. With several models that exhibit BSM classification accuracies greater than 94\%, we use ensemble learning techniques to robustly classify a selected sample of BSM from the approximately 30 kyr BP site of Arroyo del Vizcaino, Uruguay.

From an evolutionary perspective, these trends seem to have started about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of encephalization, the reduction of the dental apparatus, the adoption of a fully terrestrial lifestyle, resulting in the emergence of the modern anatomical bauplan, the focalization of certain activities in the landscape, the use of stone tools, and the exit from Africa. It is in this period that clear taphonomic evidence of a switch in diet with respect to Pliocene hominins occurred, with the adoption of carnivory. Until now, the degree of carnivorism in early humans remained controversial. A persistent hypothesis is that hominins acquired meat irregularly (potentially as fallback food) and opportunistically through klepto-foraging. Here, we test this hypothesis and show, in contrast, that the butchery practices of early Pleistocene hominins (unveiled through systematic study of the patterning and intensity of cut marks on their prey) could not have resulted from having frequent secondary access to carcasses. We provide evidence of hominin primary access to animal resources and emphasize the role that meat played in their diets, their ecology and their anatomical evolution, ultimately resulting in the ecologically unrestricted terrestrial adaptation of our species. This has major implications to the evolution of human physiology and potentially for the evolution of the human brain.},

The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited.

Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits.

	abstract = {Sedimentary abrasion and postdepositional damage to fossil remains are of great interest if considering the possible distortion they could produce in the  archaeological and paleontological record. Since their discovery, natural agents  such as trampling phenomena have been a topic of great taphonomic interest.  Nevertheless, the majority of investigation into these traces has focused almost  exclusively on their differentiation from other anthropic agents such as cut  marks. In recent years, advances into bone surface modification analysis via  geometric morphometrics have proven useful for in-depth characterization of  different taphonomic traces; including cut, tooth and percussion marks. Through  this, a preliminary study of trampling marks using advanced 3D digital microscopy  was able to detect differences between what have since been known as scratch and  graze marks. The present study expands from this, developing a more detailed  analysis of these traces. Here, we use advanced data science techniques to  provide a means of understanding trampling mark variations, contributing to our  knowledge of site formation processes. Our results show how scratch and graze  marks are a product of progressional decay and changes in cortical hardness,  providing a new means of understanding taphonomic processes. LAY DESCRIPTION: The  study of microscopic bone surface modifications in archaeology and palaeontology  is of great importance, allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the formation  of a site and providing a means of interpreting the fossil register. The damage  that sedimentary abrasion can produce, however, is likely to distort and  influence these studies, thus requiring a detailed understanding of the different  traces that can be found on different materials. Here, we use advanced 3D digital  microscopy and pattern recognition algorithms to analyse the different marks  produced in different sedimentological contexts, also controlling for other  variables such as the state of the bone when buried, the type of bone and the  time exposed to these types of damages. Through this detailed microscopic  analysis of these types of damages, we are able to conclude that morphological  variations in trampling marks are product of the state of decay when the bones  are buried.},

Previous works have pointed out the relationship between flake attributes and prediction of flake mass. This study builds on previous works by using data from an experimental collection of flakes. Estimated mass was arrived at by generating a multiple linear regression model that combines several predictive variables. Variable selection for model training was carried out by using best subset selection, which evaluates all possible combinations of variables. Evaluation of the model was performed by computing common machine learning statistics along with estimated percentage error. Results make it possible to determine the best variables and estimate their relationships with flake mass. On the other hand, results also show that although the model is slightly biased and performs adequately, it has a limited inferential ability, especially when compared with other methods/indexes employed to estimate reduction.},

These deposits provide important insights into Native American socioeconomic organization but are also quite rare: only about 50 such rings have been documented to date. Recent work using automated LiDAR analysis demonstrates that many more shell rings likely exist than are currently recorded in state archaeological databases. Here, we use deep learning, a form of machine intelligence, to detect shell ring deposits and identify their geographic range in LiDAR data from South Carolina. We corroborate our results using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multispectral data, and a random forest analysis. We conclude that a greater number of shell rings exist and that their distribution expanded further north than currently documented. Our evidence suggests that ring-construction was a more widespread and common practice during the mid-Holocene.},

A crucial component of iron manufacturing was the production of charcoal, which was often created in charcoal piles. These features are visible in LiDAR (light detection and ranging) datasets. These charcoal piles vary in their morphology by region, and training data for some feature types are severely lacking. Here, we investigate the potential for machine automation to aid archaeologists in recording charcoal piles with limited training data availability in a forested region of Jonkoping County, Sweden. We first use hydrological depression algorithms to conduct a preliminary assessment of the study region and compile suitable training data for charcoal production sites. Then, we use these datasets to train a series of RetinaNet deep learning models, which are less computationally expensive than many popular deep learning architectures (e.g., R-CNNs), allowing for greater usability. Together, our results demonstrate how charcoal piles can be automatically extracted from LiDAR datasets, which has great implications for improving our understanding of the long-term environmental impact of the iron industry across Northern Europe. Furthermore, our workflow for developing and implementing deep learning models for archaeological research can expand the use of such methods to regions that lack suitable training data.},

With impending climate-related risks such as increased coastal erosion and rising sea levels, coupled with rapid urban development, gaps in our knowledge of the human history of this continent are in jeopardy of becoming permanent. Spaceborne and aerial remote sensing instruments are powerful tools for producing relatively complete records of archaeological settlement patterns and human behavior at landscape scales. These sensors allow for massive amounts of information to be recorded and analyzed in short spans of time and offer an effective means to increase survey areas and the discovery of new cultural deposits. In this paper, we review various case studies throughout Africa dealing with aerial and satellite remote sensing applications to landscape archaeology in order to highlight recent developments and future research avenues. Specifically, we argue that (semi)automated remote sensing methods stemming from machine learning developments will prove vital to expanding our knowledge base of Africa's archaeological record. This is especially important for coastal and island regions of the continent where climate change threatens the survival of much of the archaeological record.},

The results show that these bones were mostly broken by anthropic action, while some were slightly ravaged by carnivores, probably hyaenas.

However, it remains unclear whether it can accurately detect historical buildings in RS imagery. Here we proposed a new deep transfer learning approach based on aerial photographs to automatically detect Hakka Weilong Houses (HWHs), a famous type of historical residence and an important cultural symbol of Hakka, a Han Chinese subgroup across the world. An RS image dataset, namely Hakka Weilong House Image Dataset (HWHID), was created by using aerial photographs of the urban and suburban Meizhou, which is called the world Hakka capital. The dataset was randomly shuffled into training and testing ones with a ratio of 8:2. Our approach used ResNet50 as the backbone transfer network and YOLO v2 as a training framework. Experimental results showed that the average precision was 0.9599 +/- 0.0150, the loss rate was 0.0250, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for training was 0.1580, and the average detecting time per image clip was 0.0383 +/- 0.0150 second, suggesting that our model has a high accuracy and an excellent performance for the HWH detection task. Our findings provide concrete evidences that aerial-imagery-based deep transfer learning can be used as a new archaeological RS method to detect historical buildings accurately and rapidly in aerial photographs.},

The selection of formal attributes to allow effective measurement and comparison of complex shapes, though, presents a crucial challenge to systematic study. Alongside fabric composition and surface treatment, consistent linear dimensions offer helpful metrics for assessing standardized production. More difficult to measure, though, are the many finely graduated variations in shape that can reflect how these processes were implemented and the limits to large-scale serial productions like those of the ancient Mediterranean world. We offer here a new method and computational pipeline, developed using open-source libraries, to quantify morphological similarities and differences among ceramics. Grounded in point cloud comparison, our method enables comprehensive 3D characterization of geometries down to the pixel level and leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and high-speed data structures for efficiency and scalability across large assemblages. Case studies of transport amphoras from two late antique shipwrecks off the coast of southwest Turkey demonstrate the robustness of the methodology and pipeline. Together, they provide an analytically rigorous and flexible approach to quantifying formal variation within a dataset. The first results suggest strategies for controlling the capacities of these transport jars within late ancient systems of production, but the method should also prove useful in formal analysis of artifacts of other forms and contexts.},

	abstract = {Besides the demonstration of the findings, modern museums organize educational programs which aim to experience and knowledge sharing combined with entertainment rather than to pure learning. Toward that effort, 2D and 3D digital representations are gradually replacing the traditional recording of the findings through photos or drawings. The present paper refers to a project that aims to create 3D textured models of two lekythoi that are exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens in Greece; on the surfaces of these lekythoi scenes of the adventures of Odysseus are depicted. The project is expected to support the production of an educational movie and some other relevant interactive educational programs for the museum. The creation of accurate developments of the paintings and of accurate 3D models is the basis for the visualization of the adventures of the mythical hero. The data collection was made by using a structured light scanner consisting of two machine vision cameras that are used for the determination of geometry of the object, a high resolution camera for the recording of the texture, and a DLP projector. The creation of the final accurate 3D textured model is a complicated and tiring procedure which includes the collection of geometric data, the creation of the surface, the noise filtering, the merging of individual surfaces, the creation of a c-mesh, the creation of the UV map, the provision of the texture and, finally, the general processing of the 3D textured object. For a better result a combination of commercial and in-house software made for the automation of various steps of the procedure was used. The results derived from the above procedure were especially satisfactory in terms of accuracy and quality of the model. However, the procedure was proved to be time consuming while the use of various software packages presumes the services of a specialist.},

The theorem is developed based on an assumption of the existence of linear connections between the ancient locations of some pyramids in Giza, Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur. The theorem is proved mathematically through the construction of an optimization model that combined hypothesis testing and regression analysis. The model examined 43 royal pyramids. The results emphasized the existence of mathematical linear relationships of 34 that represent all the known royal pyramids constructed starting from the first true pyramid of King Senefru at the fourth dynasty till the last constructed pyramid at the eighteenth dynasty for King Ahmose excluding Khufu and Khafre pyramids.

Cultural Heritage around the globe suffers from wars, natural disasters and human negligence. The importance of digital documentation is well recognized and there is an increasing pressure to document our heritage both nationally and internationally. For this reason, the three-dimensional scanning and modeling of sites and artifacts of cultural heritage have remarkably increased in recent years. The semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential step of the entire pipeline; in fact, it allows to decompose complex architectures in single elements, which are then enriched with meaningful information within Building Information Modelling software. Notwithstanding, this step is very time consuming and completely entrusted on the manual work of domain experts, far from being automatized. This work describes a method to label and cluster automatically a point cloud based on a supervised Deep Learning approach, using a state-of-the-art Neural Network called PointNet++. Despite other methods are known, we have choose PointNet++ as it reached significant results for classifying and segmenting 3D point clouds. PointNet++ has been tested and improved, by training the network with annotated point clouds coming from a real survey and to evaluate how performance changes according to the input training data. It can result of great interest for the research community dealing with the point cloud semantic segmentation, since it makes public a labelled dataset of CH elements for further tests.},

It is well known that Laser Scanner, Photogrammetry and Computer Vision are very attractive tools for archaeologists, although the integration of representation of space and representation of archaeological time has not yet found a methodological standard of reference. We try to develop an integrated system for archaeological 3D survey and all other types of archaeological data and knowledge through integrating observable (material) and non-graphic (interpretive) data. Survey plays a central role, since it is both a metric representation of the archaeological site and, to a wider extent, an interpretation of it (being also a common basis for communication between the 2 teams). More specifically 3D survey is crucial, allowing archaeologists to connect actual spatial assets to the stratigraphic formation processes (i.e. to the archaeological time) and to translate spatial observations into historical interpretation of the site.
We propose a common formalism for describing photogrammetrical survey and archaeological knowledge stemming from ontologies: Indeed, ontologies are fully used to model and store 3D data and archaeological knowledge. Xe equip this formalism with a qualitative representation of time. Stratigraphic analyses (both of excavated deposits and of upstanding structures) are closely related to E. C. Harris theory of "Stratigraphic Unit" ("US" from now on). Every US is connected to the others by geometric, topological and, eventually, temporal links, and are recorded by the 3D photogrammetric survey. However, the limitations of the Harris Matrix approach lead to use another representation formalism for stratigraphic relationships, namely Qualitative Constraints Networks (QCN) successfully used in the domain of knowledge representation and reasoning in artificial intelligence for representing temporal relations.},

From the very beginning of photography, during the first half of 19th century, people were amazed by this new media that could record all aspects of a scene with great detail. Soon though, everybody started wondering why would such an impressive innovation fail to record colors? A process of trials and errors then started (induding the most successful and pioneer one, involving the use of potato starch, by Lu-miere brothers) aiming to add colors to photographs, till the consolidation of new systems (camera and film) capable to collect photographs directly in color. In the past, before and during this innovative approach, native black and white photographs were painted in the effort to give them life. Today, only few methods are available to convert a panchromatic image into a color one, and they need a number of steps and further development to work properly. The paper tries to present different methods to colorize native black and white photographs, based on available automatic or interactive Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning or Deep Learning) algorithms, on revised remote sensing procedures and on visual tricks, aiming at exploring the possible improvement in readability and interpreta-tion of photographed contests in the usual analytic process of photo-interpretation. At the same time, colorized historical photographs hold different appeal in the general public and have the potential to attract and involve non-experts in the archaeological/historical reconstruction phases.},

The parameters include soil composition, climatic indicators, terrain, level of cosmic radiation, methane fluctuations places, the equator zone, promising places for research, and successful landing places of the previous missions. Based on this, we justified the choice of the building complex location, which is the decisive factor for construction. An important aspect is also the determination of the planet colonization stages and the building requirements based on the needs of the colony.
A project proposal has been developed for the second stage of planetary colonization. A colony is a quasi-closed system with its own "life cycle", consuming only its own resources and available resources of the planet.
The viability parameters of the project determine the full colony "life cycle". We propose the hierarchical system of functions of the research mission complex. It includes five main functions: research, transport, residential, production, and recycling. The principle of hierarchy is used for the development of functional parameters of premises and the determination of links between them. In general, three blocks can be distinguished: residential, scientific, technical, and warehouse, which is organically interconnected. The system of functions is maximally optimized for human needs in Martian conditions and is designed to integrate artificial intelligence into the colony. However, the problems considered in the article are only a part of a wide range of technical, transport, financial, and other tasks that make up the range of issues of Mars development.},

	abstract = {The inability to prevent or eliminate illicit trafficking of cultural goods is not limited to failed-state environments or any specific part of the globe. While the antiquities market denies that this illicit trade is a widespread phenomenon, the international community and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) overwhelmingly recognize the problem indicating that organized crime is involved at all stages. Nowadays, web platforms play host to groups dedicated to illegal archaeological excavations and Illicit trade of cultural goods. Looters have the freedom to connect online with potential buyers around the world. At the same time, social media platform monitoring in search of criminal activities conducted by LEAs is poor due to the lack of expertise, efficient tools to scan the massive amounts of data, and funds. The COVID-19 crisis has compounded the problem by driving more and more dealers and buyers online - where they are discovering that by joining certain unmonitored groups, they can enter the illegal market with ease. The EU funded SIGNIFICANCE project (Stop Illicit heritaGe traffickiNg wIth artiFICiAl iNtelligenCE) has been designed to boost LEAs investigation capabilities in monitoring online illegal activities on social media platforms, the web and the dark web for the identification of cultural property crimes, exploiting Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning algorithms for guaranteeing the successful prosecution of perpetrators unveiling criminal networks.},

In this paper, we pose the preliminary question if this increasing availability of information actually needs new computerized techniques, and Artificial Intelligence methods, to make new and deeper understanding into archaeological problems. Simply said, while it is a fact that Deep Learning (DL) has become prevalent as a type of machine learning design inspired by the way humans learn, and utilized to perform automatic actions people might describe as intelligent, we want to anticipate, here, a discussion around the subject whether machines, trained following this procedure, can extrapolate, from archaeological data, concepts and meaning in the same way that humans would do. Even prior to getting to technical results, we will start our reflection with a very basic concept: Is a collection of satellite images with notable archaeological sites informative enough to instruct a DL machine to discover new archaeological sites, as well as other potential locations of interest? Further, what if similar results could be reached with less intelligent machines that learn by having people manually program them with rules? Finally: If with barrier of meaning we refer to the extent to which human-like understanding can be achieved by a machine, where should be posed that barrier in the archaeological data science?},

Currently, there are three main hypotheses for  this expansion. The aim of this paper was to test the so-called "hybrid  hypothesis," which states that the movement of people, cultural diffusion and  language diffusion all occurred simultaneously. For this purpose, we examined an  archaeological Deep Data set with a machine learning method termed time series  clustering and with emerging hot spot analysis. The latter required two  archaeology-specific modifications: The archaeological trend map and the  multiscale emerging hot spot analysis. As a result, we were able to detect two  migrations in the Eastern Alps between c. 500 and c. 700 CE. Based on the  convergence of evidence from archaeology, linguistics, and population genetics,  we have identified the migrants as Alpine Slavs, i.e., people who spoke Slavic  and shared specific common ancestry.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach using remote sensing big data for the detection of archaeological mounds in Cholistan (Pakistan). The Cholistan Desert presents one of the largest concentrations of Indus Civilization sites (from ca. 3300 to 1500 BC). Cholistan has figured prominently in theories about changes in water availability, the rise and decline of the Indus Civilization, and the transformation of fertile monsoonal alluvial plains into an extremely arid margin. This paper implements a multisensor, multitemporal machine-learning approach for the remote detection of archaeological mounds. A classifier algorithm that employs a large-scale collection of synthetic-aperture radar and multispectral images has been implemented in Google Earth Engine, resulting in an accurate probability map for mound-like signatures across an area that covers ca. 36,000 km(2). The results show that the area presents many more archaeological mounds than previously recorded, extending south and east into the desert, which has major implications for understanding the archaeological significance of the region. The detection of small ({\textless}5 ha) to large mounds ({\textgreater}30 ha) suggests that there were continuous shifts in settlement location. These shifts are likely to reflect responses to a dynamic and changing hydrological network and the influence of the progressive northward advance of the desert in a long-term process that culminated in the abandonment of much of the settled area during the Late Harappan period.},

	abstract = {Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) currently includes thousands of cultivars. Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is  done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to  identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low  genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely  successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is  currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts  were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool,  mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate  varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning  approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based,  applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved  classification results of 91\% to 93\% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or  charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively. We show that when  classifying 8 groups, enhanced accuracy levels can be achieved using a  "tournament" approach. Future development of this new methodology can lead to an  effective seed classification tool, significantly improving the fields of  archaeobotany, as well as general taxonomy.},

	abstract = {Settlement models help to understand the social–ecological functioning of landscape and associated land use and land cover change. One of the issues of settlement modeling is that models are typically used to explore the relationship between settlement locations and associated influential factors (e.g., slope and aspect). However, few studies in settlement modeling adopted landscape visibility analysis. Landscape visibility provides useful information for understanding human decision-making associated with the establishment of settlements. In the past years, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated their capabilities in improving the performance of the settlement modeling and particularly capturing the nonlinear relationship between settlement locations and their drivers. However, simulation models using machine learning algorithms in settlement modeling are still not well studied. Moreover, overfitting issues and optimization of model parameters are major challenges for most machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we sought to pursue two research objectives. First, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of viewsheds and landscape visibility to the simulation modeling of - settlement locations. The second objective is to examine the performance of the machine learning algorithm-based simulation models for settlement location studies. Our study region is located in the metropolitan area of Oyo Empire, Nigeria, West Africa, ca. AD 1570–1830, and its pre-Imperial antecedents, ca. AD 1360–1570. We developed an event-driven spatial simulation model enabled by random forest algorithm to represent dynamics in settlement systems in our study region. Experimental results demonstrate that viewsheds and landscape visibility may offer more insights into unveiling the underlying mechanism that drives settlement locations. Random forest algorithm, as a machine learning algorithm, provide solid support for establishing the relationship between settlement occurrences and their drivers.},

We present a novel pluralistic building contour completion framework. A feature suggestion component uses an entropy-based model to request information from the user for the next most informative location in the image. Then, an image completion component trained using self-supervision and procedurally generated content produces a partial or full completion. In our synthetic and real-world experiments for archaeological sites in Turkey, with up to only 4 iterations, we complete building footprints having only 10-15\% of the ancient structure initially visible. We also compare to various state-of-the-art methods and show our superior quantitative/qualitative performance.

	abstract = {Image segmentation is a fundamental task that has benefited from recent advances in machine learning. One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.},

	abstract = {Research regarding the similarity measurements of 3D craniofacial models (including 3D skull and face models) is an important research direction in fields such as archaeology, forensic science, and anthropology and represents a meaningful and challenging task. Its major challenges are the fact that 3D skulls are geometric models with multiple holes and complex topologies, there are facial expression changes on the 3D faces. Therefore, the general 3D shape similarity measurements, which are sensitive to boundaries and expression changes, make it impossible to simultaneously measure skull and face similarity. In this paper, we define a 3D signature to describe the pure intrinsic structure and distinguish the similar basic shape and complex topology of 3D skulls and faces: the harmonic wave kernel signature (HWKS). The HWKS is a point descriptor involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which is able to effectively extract geometrical and topological information from 3D skulls and faces. Based on the HWKS, we provide an effective pipeline for 3D skull and face similarity measurement by calculating the cosine distance between the HWKS values of 3D skulls and faces. By making comparisons with the wave kernel signature, the HWKS simultaneously describes both local and global properties of a shape. Results from a number of experiments have already shown that our framework is suitable for both measure 3D skull similarity and face similarity, and more importantly, measuring skull similarity and face similarity are two independent processes although using the same framework. By using the same measurement method for 3D skull similarity and face similarity, we observe an effective craniofacial relationship under unified metrics: The change rate of skull similarity is generally consistent with the corresponding face similarity, indicating the correlation between the shape of the 3D skull and its corresponding 3D face shape. And our experimental results show the rationality and effectiveness of this method, which refers to the previous researchers measure the similarity of the reconstructed face from the original skull to reflect the similarity of the original skull.},

In this paper, based on the synthetic feature method, we propose a novel 3D skull descriptor, synthetic wave kernel distance distribution (SWKDD) constructed by the laplace-beltrami operator. By defining SWKDD, we obtain a concise global skull representation method and transform the complex 3D skull similarity measurement into a simple 1D vector similarity measurement. First, we give the definition and calculation of SWKDD and analyse its properties. Second, we represent a framework for 3D skull similarity measurement using the SWKDD of 3D skulls and details of the calculation steps involved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method by calculating the similarity measurement of 3D skulls based on the real craniofacial database.},

The second part guides trainees through "deep description," where they explore objective and subjective findings of three different objects. The exercise concludes with a debrief and application of concepts learned to everyday clinical practice.

The last decades have seen a rise of multiple government programs to protect wolf  populations. Nevertheless, these programs have been controversial in rural areas,  product of the predation of livestock by carnivores. As a response to such  issues, governments have presented large scale economic plans to compensate the  respected owners. The current issue lies in the lack of reliable techniques that  can be used to detect the predator responsible for livestock predation. This has  led to complications when obtaining subsidies, creating conflict between  landowners and government officials. The objectives of this study therefore are  to provide a new alternative approach to differentiating between tooth marks of  different predators responsible for livestock predation. Here we present the use  of geometric morphometrics and Machine Learning algorithms to discern between  different carnivores through in depth analysis of the tooth marks they leave on  bone.

	abstract = {Predictive models are central to both archaeological research and cultural resource management. Yet, archaeological applications of predictive models are often insufficient due to small training data sets, inadequate statistical techniques, and a lack of theoretical insight to explain the responses of past land use to predictor variables. Here we address these critiques and evaluate the predictive power of four statistical approaches widely used in ecological modeling-generalized linear models, generalized additive models, maximum entropy, and random forests-to predict the locations of Formative Period (2100-650 BP) archaeological sites in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We assess each modeling approach using a threshold-independent measure, the area under the curve (AUC), and threshold-dependent measures, like the true skill statistic. We find that the majority of the modeling approaches struggle with archaeological datasets due to the frequent lack of true-absence locations, which violates model assumptions of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and random forests, as well as measures of their predictive power (AUC). Maximum entropy is the only method tested here which is capable of utilizing pseudo-absence points (inferred absence data based on known presence data) and controlling for a non-representative sampling of the landscape, thus making maximum entropy the best modeling approach for common archaeological data when the goal is prediction. Regression-based approaches may be more applicable when prediction is not the goal, given their grounding in well-established statistical theory. Random forests, while the most powerful, is not applicable to archaeological data except in the rare case where true-absence data exist. Our results have significant implications for the application of predictive models by archaeologists for research and conservation purposes and highlight the importance of understanding model assumptions.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/202142724},
	abstract = {Context. The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) has obtained precise photometry in 12 specially designed filters for large numbers of Galactic stars. Deriving their precise stellar atmospheric parameters and individual elemental abundances is crucial for studies of Galactic structure and the assembly history and chemical evolution of our Galaxy.
Aims. Our goal is to estimate not only stellar parameters (effective temperature, T-eff, surface gravity, log g, and metallicity, [Fe/H]), but also [alpha/Fe] and four elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Ca/Fe]) using data from the first data release (DR1) of J-PLUS.
Methods. By combining recalibrated photometric data from J-PLUS DR1, Gaia DR2, and spectroscopic labels from the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, we designed and trained a set of cost-sensitive neural networks, the CSNet, to learn the nonlinear mapping from stellar colours to their labels. Special attention was paid to the poorly populated regions of the label space by giving different weights according to their density distribution.
Results. We achieved precisions of delta T-eff similar to 55 K, delta log g similar to 0.15 dex, and delta [Fe/H] similar to 0.07 dex, respectively, over a wide range of temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities. The uncertainties of the abundance estimates for [alpha/Fe] and the four individual elements are in the 0.04-0.08 dex range. We compare our parameter and abundance estimates with those from other spectroscopic catalogs such as the Apache Point Observatory for Galactic Evolution Experiment and the Galactic Archaeology with High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph and find an overall good agreement.
Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of well-designed, high-quality photometric data for determinations of stellar parameters as well as individual elemental abundances. Applying the method to J-PLUS DR1, we obtained the aforementioned parameters for about two million stars, providing an outstanding dataset for chemo-dynamic analyses of the Milky Way. The catalog of the estimated parameters is publicly accessible.},

This study is devoted to rapidly reconstructing 3D personalized mandibles, especially when the mandible is severely damaged or totally lost.

The predictor variable is an input cranium, while the response variables is a full mandible. The linear relationship between the cranium and mandible is obtained based on a number of skull samples, which is used as prior knowledge. The PCA method reduces the dimensionality of the skull data to improve the accuracy and speed of the reconstruction process. Experiments are conducted based on 215 skull models in the Chinese craniofacial database established in the study of craniofacial morphology informatics at Beijing Normal University. In our experiments, parameters are modified to help improve the reconstruction results. The proposed method exhibits higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods according to comparison experiments results. Moreover, this method is robust to various types of input data and noise.

With the rapid growth of data volume, effective methods  are required for data analytics for the large geochemical data sets. In recent  years, spatial machine learning technologies have been proven to have the  potential to reveal hidden spatial patterns in order to extract geochemical  information. In this study, two spatial clustering techniques of Getis-Ord G(i)*  statistic and K-means clustering analysis were performed on 15 PTEs in 6,862  topsoil samples from the Tellus datasets of Northern Ireland to investigate the  hidden spatial patterns and association with their controlling factors. The  spatial clustering patterns of hot spots (high values) and cold spots (low  values) for the 15 PTEs were revealed, showing clear association with geological  features, especially peat and basalt. Peat was associated with high  concentrations of Bi, Pb, Sb and Sn, while basalt was associated with high  concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, V and Zn. The high concentrations of As,  Ba, Mo and U were associated with mixture of various lithologies, indicating the  complicated influences on them. In addition, three hidden patterns in the 6,862  soil samples were revealed by K-means clustering analysis. The soil samples in  the first and second clusters were overlaid on the peatland and basalt formation,  respectively, while the samples in the third cluster were overlaid on the mixture  of the other lithologies. These hidden patterns of soil samples were consistent  with the spatial clustering patterns for PTEs, highlighting the dominant control  of peat and basalt in the topsoil of Northern Ireland. This study demonstrates  the power of spatial machine learning techniques in identifying hidden spatial  patterns, providing evidences to extract geochemical knowledge in environmental  studies.},

	abstract = {Craniofacial reconstruction is to estimate a person's face model from the skull. It can be applied in many fields such as forensic medicine, archaeology, and face  animation. Craniofacial reconstruction is based on the relationship between the  skull and the face to reconstruct the facial appearance from the skull. However,  the craniofacial structure is very complex and the relationship is not the same  in different craniofacial regions. To better represent the shape changes of the  skull and face and make better use of the correlation between different local  regions, a new craniofacial reconstruction method based on region fusion strategy  is proposed in this paper. This method has the flexibility of finding the  nonlinear relationship between skull and face variables and is easy to solve.  Firstly, the skull and face are divided into five corresponding local regions;  secondly, the five regions of skull and face are mapped to low-dimensional latent  space using Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), and the nonlinear  features between skull and face are extracted; then, least square support vector  regression (LSSVR) model is trained in latent space to establish the mapping  relationship between skull region and face region; finally, perform regional  fusion to achieve overall reconstruction. For the unknown skull, first divide the  region, then project it into the latent space of the skull region, then use the  trained LSSVR model to reconstruct the face of the corresponding region, and  finally perform regional fusion to realize the face reconstruction of the unknown  skull. The experimental results show that the method is effective. Compared with  other regression methods, our method is optimal. In addition, we add attributes  such as age and body mass index (BMI) to the mappings to achieve face  reconstruction with different attributes.},

To fulfill this important mission, massive amounts of information must be integrated from historical records, genealogy records, anthropological data, archaeological data, odontology data, and DNA. Previously a machine learning record-linkage application was developed to integrate DNA Family Reference Samples (FRS) data systems with the DPAA's master data. This application was shown to link large record systems with a high level of accuracy and precision. Here this work is extended to further optimize the blocking strategy used during record linkage as well as the record match alpha-level threshold for the Bayesian Classifier. Optimization of the blocking strategy was able to improve application run-time per record by 20\%. After record-match alpha-level optimization, the application was found to link 89.6\% of the record out-group to DPAA master data at an accuracy of 99.6\%. The improved run-time efficiency and match rate of the record-linkage pipeline will greatly benefit not only the DPAA's FRS import process but also the linking of other big data sources supporting the DPAA mission.},

The machine-learning method convolutional neural network (CNN) is an efficient algorithm for searching for new M 31 star cluster candidates from tens of millions of images from wide-field photometric surveys.
Aims. We search for new M 31 cluster candidates from the high-quality g- and i-band images of 21 245 632 sources obtained from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) through a CNN.
Methods. We collected confirmed M 31 clusters and noncluster objects from the literature as our training sample. Accurate double-channel CNNs were constructed and trained using the training samples. We applied the CNN classification models to the PAndAS g-and i-band images of over 21 million sources to search new M 31 cluster candidates. The CNN predictions were finally checked by five experienced human inspectors to obtain high-confidence M 31 star cluster candidates.
Results. After the inspection, we identified a catalogue of 117 new M 31 cluster candidates. Most of the new candidates are young clusters that are located in the M 31 disk. Their morphology, colours, and magnitudes are similar to those of the confirmed young disk clusters. We also identified eight globular cluster candidates that are located in the M 31 halo and exhibit features similar to those of confirmed halo globular clusters. The projected distances to the M 31 centre for three of them are larger than 100 kpc.},

In practice, this requires the  consultation of different sources of information in order to cross validate  findings and combat issues of ambiguity and equifinality. However, the  application of a multiproxy approach often generates incompatible data, and might  therefore still provide ambiguous results. This paper explores the potential of a  simple digital framework to increase the explanatory power of multiproxy data by  enabling the incorporation of incompatible, ambiguous datasets in a single model.  In order to achieve this, Bayesian confirmation was used in combination with  decision trees. The results of phytolith and geochemical analyses carried out on  soil samples from ephemeral sites in Jordan are used here as a case study. The  combination of the two datasets as part of a single model enabled us to refine  the initial interpretation of the use of space at the archaeological sites by  providing an alternative identification for certain activity areas. The potential  applications of this model are much broader, as it can also help researchers in  other domains reach an integrated interpretation of analysis results by combining  different datasets.},

These areas function as temporary storage locations for stormwater when rivers cannot cope with the amount of water. A large area, the Onlanden - 2,500 hectares-was developed as such a storage area between 2008 and 2013. This peat area contains up to 300 medieval housing areas. These 'peatmounds', named after the current visible small mound, were explicitly mentioned as a preservation goal in the project. The preservation of the peatmounds during and after the project has been guaranteed by a combination of protective measures, research, and monitoring actions. At first a risk evaluation was performed, followed by a monitoring project focusing on the preservation of the organic part of the mounds. This evaluation showed that the rewetting of the mounds might improve the overall preservation. A total of fifteen monitoring stations were a-selectively distributed over the total area, covering the four main types of land use. The measured parameters at these stations focus on the desiccation/rewetting effects. The second threat, as determined in the risk evaluation, is the growth of deep penetrating plants. These roots might disturb the archaeological profile. Preventive coverage with plastic and up to a metre of soil could prevent root growth into the archaeology. An experimental coverage showed the effectiveness of this technique, but also the risks. This paper focuses on the lessons that can be learned from this six-year project, the monitoring results, and clearly shows the benefits of a combined approach in large-scale projects.},

	abstract = {A methodology was developed to reconstruct the Roman topography and environmental features of the Sarno River plain, Italy, before the AD 79 eruption of the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. We collected, localized and digitized more than 1800 core drilling data to gain a representative network of stratigraphical information covering the entire plain. Besides other stratigraphical data including the characteristics of the pre-AD 79 stratum, the depth to the pre-AD 79 surface was identified from the available drilling documentations. Instead of a simple interpolation method, we used a machine based learning approach based on classification and regression trees to reconstruct the pre-AD 79 topography. We hypothesize that the present-day topography reflects the ancient topography and related surface processes, because volcanic deposits from the AD 79 eruption coated the ancient landscape. Thus, ancient physiographic elements of the Sarno River plain are still recognizable in the present-day topography. Therefore, a high-resolution, present-day digital elevation model (DEM) was generated. A detailed terrain analysis yielded 15 different primary and secondary topographic indices. Subsequently, a classification and regression model was applied to predict the depth of the pre-AD 79 surface combining present-day topographic indices with other physiographic data. This model was calibrated with the measured depth of the pre-AD 79 surface. The resulting pre-AD 79 DEM was compared with the classified characteristic of the pre-AD 79 stratum, identified from the drilling documentations. This allowed the reconstruction of pre-AD 79 environmental features of the Sarno River plain such as the ancient coastline, the paleo-course of the Sarno River and its floodplain.
To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first time that the pre-AD 79 topography of the Sarno River plain was systematically reconstructed using a detailed database and sophisticated data mining technologies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These approaches are generally tested in an (ideal) experimental setting but have not been applied in different contexts or 'in the wild', that is, incorporated in archaeological prospection. This research explores the applicability, knowledge discovery-on both a quantitative and qualitative level-and efficiency gain resulting from employing an automated detection tool called WODAN within (Dutch) archaeological practice. WODAN has been used to detect barrows and Celtic fields in LiDAR data from the Dutch Midden-Limburg area, which differs in archaeology, geo-(morpho)logy and land-use from the Veluwe in which it was developed. The results show that WODAN was able to detect potential barrows and Celtic fields, including previously unknown examples, and provided information about the structuring of the landscape in the past. Based on the results, combined human-computer strategies are argued, in which automated detection has a complementary, rather than a substitute role, to manual analysis. This can offset the inherent biases in manual analysis and deal with the problem that current automated detection methods only detect objects similar to the pre-defined target class(es). The incorporation of automated detection into archaeological prospection, in which the results of automated detection are used to highlight areas of interest and to enhance and add detail to existing archaeological predictive maps, seems logical and feasible.},

	abstract = {Understanding Late Pleistocene human dispersals from Africa requires understanding a multifaceted problem with factors varying in space and time, such as climate, ecology, human behavior, and population dynamics. To understand how these factors interact to affect human survival and dispersal, we have developed a realistic agent-based model that includes geographic features, climate change, and time-varying vegetation and food resources. To enhance computational efficiency, we further apply machine learning algorithms. Our approach is new in that it is designed to systematically evaluate a large-scale agent-based model, and identify its key parameters and sensitivities. Results show that parameter interactions are the major source in generating variability in human dispersal and survival/extinction scenarios. In realistic scenarios with geographical features and time-evolving climatic conditions, random fluctuations become a major source of variability in arrival times and success. Furthermore, parameter settings as different as 92\% of maximum possible difference, and occupying more than 30\% of parameter space can result in similar dispersal scenarios. This suggests that historical contingency (similar causes - different effects) and equifinality (different causes - similar effects) are primary constituents of human dispersal scenarios. While paleoanthropology, archaeology and paleogenetics now provide insights into patterns of human dispersals at an unprecedented level of detail, elucidating the causes underlying these patterns remains a major challenge.

Understanding of the structural characteristics of these materials using X-ray tomography (XRT) is of paramount importance in the process of designing future materials with similar complex heterogeneous structures. We introduce Materials Data Science algorithms centered on image analysis of XRT that support inspection and quantification of microstructure from ancient Roman concrete samples. By using XRT imaging, we access properties of two concrete samples in terms of three different material phases as well as estimation of materials fraction, visualization of the porous network and density gradients. These samples present remarkable durability in comparison with the concrete using Portland cement and nonreactive aggregates. Internal structures and respective organization might be the key to construction durability as these samples come from ocean-submersed archeological findings dated from about two thousand years ago. These are preliminary results that highlight the advantages of using non-destructive 3D XRT combined with computer vision and machine learning methods for systematic characterization of complex and irreproducible materials such as archeological samples. One significant impact of this work is the ability to reduce the amount of data for several computations to be held at minimalistic computational infrastructure, near real-time, and potentially during beamtime while materials scientists are still at the imaging facilities.},

The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns.
A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for 'Simple Faster R-CNN' was downloaded from Github.
On 737 test images (16.6 km(2)) not seen during training, 87 \% of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 \% of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m x 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km(2) area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 \% of the true grave mounds, with 89 \% false positives. On a 937 km(2) area covering Ovre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 \% of the charcoal kilns, with 38 \% false positives.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.},

	abstract = {We present a workflow to conduct a full characterization of medium to coarse-grained igneous rocks, using portable, non-invasive, and reproducible approaches. This includes: (i) Image Analysis (IA) to quantify mineral phase proportions, grain size distribution using the Weka trainable machine learning algorithm. (ii) Portable Xray fluorescence spectrometer (PXRF, Bruker Tracer IV) to quantify the whole-rock?s chemical composition. For this purpose, a specific calibration method dedicated to igneous rocks using the open-source CloudCal app was developed. It was then validated for several key elements (Si, Al, K, Ti, Ca, Fe, Mn, Sr, Ga, Ba, Rb, Zn, Nb, Zr, and Y) by analyzing certified standard reference igneous rocks. (iii) Portable Magnetic Susceptibilimeter (pMS, Bartington MS2K system) to constrain the mineralogical contribution of the samples. The operational conditions for these three methods were tested and optimized by analyzing five unprepared surfaces of igneous rocks ranging from a coarse-grained alkaline granite to a fine-grained porphyric diorite and hence, covering variable grain sizes, mineralogical contents, and whole-rock geochemical compositions. For pMS and PXRF tools, one hundred analyses were conducted as a 10 cm ? 10 cm square grid on each sample. Bootstrap analysis was implemented to establish the best grid size sampling to reach an optimized reproducibility of the whole-rock signature. For PXRF analysis, averaged compositions were compared to PXRF analysis on press-pellets and laboratory WD-XRF analysis on fused disk and solution ICP-OES (for major) and solution-ICPMS (for trace element concentrations). Ultimately, this workflow was applied in the field on granitoids from three Roman quarrying sites in the Lavezzi archipelago (southern Corsica) and tested against the Bonifacio granitic War Memorial, for which its provenance is established. Our results confirm this information and open the door to geoarchaeological provenance studies with a high spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Turbulence plays a key role in star formation in molecular clouds, affecting star cluster primordial properties. As modelling present-day objects hinges on our understanding of their initial conditions, better constraints on turbulence can result in windfalls in Galactic archaeology, star cluster dynamics, and star formation. Observationally, constraining the spectral index of turbulent gas usually involves computing spectra from velocity maps. Here, we suggest that information on the spectral index might be directly inferred from column density maps (possibly obtained by dust emission/absorption) through deep learning. We generate mock density maps from a large set of adaptive mesh refinement turbulent gas simulations using the hydro-simulation code RAMSES. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the resulting images to predict the turbulence index, optimize hyperparameters in validation and test on a holdout set. Our adopted CNN model achieves a mean squared error of 0.024 in its predictions on our holdout set, over underlying spectral indexes ranging from 3 to 4.5. We also perform robustness tests by applying our model to altered holdout set images, and to images obtained by running simulations at different resolutions. This preliminary result on simulated density maps encourages further developments on real data, where observational biases and other issues need to be taken into account.},

	abstract = {Human cultures educate children with different strategies. Ancient hunter-gatherers 200,000years ago, with bodies and brains like our own, in bands of a hundred well-known individuals or less, depended on spontaneous cooperative practice of knowledge and skills in a natural world. Before creating language, they appreciated beautiful objects and music. Anthropologists observe that similar living cultures accept that children learn in playful intent participation'. Large modern industrial states with millions of citizens competing in a global economy aim to instruct young people in scientific concepts and the rules of literacy and numeracy deemed important for employment with elaborate machines. Our psychobiological theories commonly assume that an infant starts with a body needing care and emotional regulation and a mind that assimilates concepts of objects by sensorimotor action and requires school instruction in rational principles after several years of cognitive development. Evidence from archeology and evolutionary anthropology indicates that Homo sapiens are born with an imaginative and convivial brain ready for the pleasure of shared invention and with a natural sense of beauty in handmade objects and music. In short, there are innate predispositions for culture for practicing meaningful habits and artful performances that are playfully inventive and seductive for companionship in traditions, and soon capable of grasping the clever purpose of shared tasks and tools. This knowledge of inventive human nature with esthetic and moral sensibilities has important implications for educational policy in our schools.

	abstract = {Objective: Here we present the first known examples of brachydactyly from an Andean archaeological context by describing the affected bones, presenting a differential diagnosis, and discussing the cultural implications of there being shortened metapodials in multiple tombs.
Materials: 3232 well-preserved tubular bones representing an MNI of 250 human adults.
Methods: Each bone was visually inspected. Measurements were taken with an osteometric board, sliding calipers, and a flexible tape measure.
Results: Of 1210 metapodials excavated from eight burial contexts, ten were atypically short.
Conclusions: The ten shortened elements represent an MNI of three individuals with brachydactyly from two tombs. The presence of at least two individuals with brachydactyly in one tomb adds support to a previous suggestion that tombs were used for familial interment. It is plausible that the third individual from a different tomb was related to the other two, and the different burial contexts may reflect postmarital practices.
Significance: These cases offer insight into tomb use and underscore the importance of identifying rare developmental anomalies in the archaeological record as their presence may indicate genetic relationships within or among archaeological cemeteries.
Limitations: With commingled contexts and incomplete recovery of skeletal remains, individualizing the brachydactylous elements was not possible. There is also a lack of comparative data from other Andean sites. Suggestions for Further Research: Identify more Andean cases of brachydactyly to learn if the relatively frequent involvement of the first digit is more common among Andean skeletal samples than North American, or if it is unique to Marcajirca.},

This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica. With the future development of tailored machine learning approaches of feature extraction and pattern detection, Sentinel-2 can become extremely useful to screen wider regions with short revisiting times and to undertake comparative condition assessment analyses of different heritage sites.},

The study of ancient celadon is of great significance for understanding the cultural exchange, of which the classification of ancient celadon is an important part. The goal of this work was to establish a reliable celadon classification model based on EDXRF, machine learning algorithm and Mahalanobis distance. The data set for training machine learning models is constructed of 12 components in the ceramic body and glaze, which are measured by EDXRF. Comparing the predicted results of four machine learning models, the Random forest algorithm performed best on all evaluation indicators. Therefore, the Random forest was the most suitable algorithm for celadon classification with an average accuracy of 96.41\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.985. The contents of the chemical compositions of the sample were determined to be within the corresponding composition ranges of the predicted category. The chemical compositions with greater influence in identifying the categories of ancient ceramics in Random forest were chosen as the characteristic parameters. The general rules of the Mahalanobis distance from the sample to the category center were summarized and used to describe the similarity between the sample and the predicted category. The celadon classification model established by combining these two methods can make a more specific and accurate prediction. The celadon classification model was also adopted to predict the categories of samples excavated from the Jizhou kiln and Chuzhou site. The excellent prediction capability of the model was verified by comparing results with the corresponding background information of samples.},

Mapping anthropogenic features plays a key role in understanding historic land use dynamics during the 17th to early 20th centuries, however previous studies have primarily used manual or semi-automated digitization methods, which are time consuming for broad-scale mapping. This study applies fully-automated deep convolutional neural networks (i.e., U-Net) with LiDAR derivatives to identify relict charcoal hearths (RCHs), a type of historical land use feature. Results show that slope, hillshade, and Visualization for Archaeological Topography (VAT) rasters work well in six localized test regions (spatial scale: {\textless} 1.5 km(2), best F1 score: 95.5\%), but also at broader extents at the town level (spatial scale: 493 km(2), best F1 score: 86\%). The model performed best in areas with deciduous forest and high slope terrain (e.g., {\textgreater} 15 degrees) (F1 score: 86.8\%) compared to coniferous forest and low slope terrain (e.g., {\textless} 15 degrees) (F1 score: 70.1\%).

Remote sensing using airborne and satellite sensors is an essential tool for rapidly investigating human traces over large surfaces of our planet, but even large monumental structures may be visible as only faint indications on the surface. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using airborne laser scanning data to address a needle-in-a-haystack problem, which involves the search for remnants of Viking ring fortresses throughout Denmark. First ring detection was applied using the Hough circle transformations and template matching, which detected 202,048 circular features in Denmark. This was reduced to 199 candidate sites by using their geometric properties and the application of machine learning techniques to classify the cultural and topographic context of the features. Two of these near perfectly circular features are convincing candidates for Viking Age fortresses, and two are candidates for either glacial landscape features or simple meteor craters. Ground-truthing revealed the latter sites as ice age features, while the cultural heritage sites BorgO and Tr ae lbanke urge renewed archaeological investigation in the light of our findings. The fact that machine learning identifies compelling new candidate sites for ring fortresses demonstrates the power of the approach. Our automatic approach is applicable worldwide where digital terrain models are available to search for cultural heritage sites, geomorphological features, and meteor impact craters.},

	abstract = {This paper begins by calling attention to a puzzling feature of our deep past: an apparent mis-match between morphological evolution in our lineage, including the expansion of our brain and neocortex, and changes in material culture. Three ideas might explain this mis-match. (a) The apparent mis-match is an illusion: change in material culture is indeed driven by biological evolution, but of a kind difficult to identify in the fossil record; (b) the mismatch is caused by the fact that material culture is sensitive to the social and demographic environment, not just the native cognitive capacities of individual agents. Innovation and its uptake is more reliable in larger social worlds. (c) The mis-match is made possible by adaptive phenotypic plasticity; in particular, cognitive plasticity. Just as material culture evolves through cumulative cultural learning, so too do cognitive skills, including ones which make innovations in, and the transmission of, material culture more efficient. This paper is targeted on the second of these ideas, and distinguishes three different versions of the view that increases in social scale support increases in the complexity of material culture. Those are: (i) cultural selection is more efficient in larger social worlds; (ii) larger social worlds support more specialisation, which in turn supports a more complex material culture; (iii) cultural learning is more efficient in larger social worlds. The paper argues that the first two of these pathways are probably more important than the third in explaining otherwise puzzling features of the archaeological and ethnographic record.},

	abstract = {It is a common case that archaeological finds are frequently found in fragments and cannot always be reassembled in their entirety. Additionally, the completion of their shape and volume is sometimes costly and occasionally requires a lot of manual work, in particular for exhibition purposes. As a first step, improving the geometry of the fragments could potentially help the archaeological conservators in the assembling process. In this direction, in this paper we propose an end-to-end hybrid approach (i.e. point clouds to benefit from the limited complexity and creating results in mesh benefiting from their visualization capabilities) for the digital auto-completion of fragmented archaeological artifacts with missing parts in combination with a novel self-supervised data augmentation scheme in order to address a significant limitation in the archaeological domain (i.e. limited available observations and absence of the complete object). Our approach uses only 5 fragments of a partly preserved archaeological object for training. As a first step, an object (i.e artifact fragment) in mesh representation is converted to point cloud, from which more fragments of the incomplete original object are artificially generated, with the help of 3D surfaces, to augment the dataset. This dataset is then passed in a GAN-based Cascaded refinement network for generating a complete output, which is, finally, converted back to a mesh. Our experiments showed that the proposed hybrid approach, can be successfully used to complete and restore the geometry of a partly preserved archaeological object without having ever seen the complete form of it. However, due to the complexity of the fragments, such methods in most cases cannot generate their fine decorative and surface details. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Since 2012, however, a breakthrough has been made in the field of image recognition through deep learning. We have tested the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of archaeological features. Our case study is the qanat systems of the Erbil Plain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The signature of the underground qanat systems on the remote sensing data are the semi-circular openings of their vertical shafts. We choose to focus on qanat shafts because they are promising targets for pattern recognition and because the richness and the extent of the qanat landscapes cannot be properly captured across vast territories without automated techniques. Our project is the first effort to use automated techniques on historic satellite imagery that takes advantage of neither the spectral imagery resolution nor very high (sub-meter) spatial resolution.},

We considered several variations of the VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve the task of classifying visualized example structures from previously manually annotated ALS images of man-made aguadas, buildings and platforms, as well as images of surrounding terrain (four classes and over 12,000 anthropogenic structures). We investigated how various parameters impact model performance, using: (a) six different visualization blends, (b) two different edge buffer sizes, (c) additional data augmentation and (d) architectures with different numbers of untrainable, frozen layers at the beginning of the network. Many of the models learned under the different scenarios exceeded the overall classification accuracy of 95\%. Using overall accuracy, terrain precision and recall (detection rate) per class of anthropogenic structure as criteria, we selected visualization with slope, sky-view factor and positive openness in separate bands; image samples with a two-pixels edge buffer; Keras data augmentation; and five frozen layers as the optimal combination of building blocks for learning our CNN model.},

	abstract = {Global reconstruction of two-dimensional wall paintings (frescoes) from fragments is an important problem for many archaeological sites. The goal is to find the global position and rotation for each fragment so that all fragments jointly "reconstruct" the original surface (i.e., solve the puzzle). Manual fragment placement is difficult and time-consuming, especially when fragments are irregularly shaped and uncolored. Systems have been proposed to first acquire 3D surface scans of the fragments and then use computer algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem. These systems work well for small test cases and for puzzles with distinctive features, but fail for larger reconstructions of real wall paintings with eroded and missing fragments due to the complexity of the reconstruction search space. We address the search problem with an unsupervised genetic algorithm: we evolve a pool of partial reconstructions that grow through recombination and selection over the course of generations. We introduce a novel algorithm for combining partial reconstructions that is robust to noise and outliers, and we provide a new selection procedure that balances fitness and diversity in the population. In experiments with a benchmark dataset, our algorithm is able to achieve larger and more accurate global reconstructions than previous automatic algorithms.},

In this study we apply inductive modelling to compare the spatial structure of the settlement systems of hunter-fisher-gatherer groups (Narva and Combed Ware Culture) and early agrarian communities (Corded Ware Culture) in Stone Age Estonia.We conceptualise settlement system formation as a point process and develop a first order point process model representing the environmental suitability for habitation based on geomorphological, soil and proximity to water. We use MaxEnt and the SDMTune machine learning framework for building the model, variable selection and estimation. The model is applied to the two communities and the effects of the variables and the resulting spatial patterns compared.The statistical analysis indicated higher predictive power for hunter-fisher-gatherer sites, which might result from higher variety of agrarian activities, different socio-economic organization or effects of spatial structure of the landscape.The spatial comparison indicates significant differences between the suitable environments for habitation between the two groups. While the hunter-fisher-gatherer population had an entirely shoreline connected settlement system the Corded Ware people inhabited the areas further away from water bodies. This resulted in significantly expanded potential space with differing spatial configuration for the incoming agrarian groups, possibly allowing tolerated immigration. The results also indicate there was a certain overlap of areas considered suitable habitation by both cultural groups, which might have caused a competition for land.},

	abstract = {The Acheulo-Yabrudian complex which constitutes the latest part of the Lower Paleolithic in the Levant provides a perspective over the nature of the transition between the Lower and Middle Paleolithic in the region. Considering the fundamental transformation in human behavior that occurred during the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex, which includes the use of habitual fire and the intensive use of predetermined blank technology among the emergence of other traits, it is of significance whether these transformations continued in the Levant from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic or whether they were completely swept away by a new wave of humans bringing with them similar as well as different sets of behaviours. This question can be best elucidated through a search of continuity in technological choices which can reflect socially-learned traditions of stone knapping. Our study is carried out on the long 16 m deep archeological sequence of Tabun Cave, by combining results from Ronen's and Jelinek's excavations, which comprise ca. 100 superimposed layers, ranging from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic. An overview of various reduction sequences, i.e., the Yabrudian scraper-blank production, the blade production of the Amudian, the exploitation of various types of cores on flakes, the variable exploitation of handaxes as cores and the Levallois technology at the site, indicates that although the Acheulo-Yabrudian and the Levantine Mousterian complexes exhibit marked differences in the macro level, there are also some significant features of similarity in the micro level, as reflected in particular technological choices within the reduction sequences that suggest some continuity in technological tradition. Exploring all ranges of reduction sequences can also provide new insights regarding the development of Levallois technology that burst at the Middle Paleolithic and demonstrate how particular technological choices that were already embedded in the knapping tradition of the Acheulo-Yabrudian are manifested in the particular method of Levallois that characterize the Mousterian of Tabun Cave.

Biochar can provide additional agronomic benefits to cropping systems, including improved crop yield, soil water holding capacity, seed germination, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil pH. To maximize the beneficial effects of biochar amendments towards the inventory, increase, and management of SOC pools, nondestructive analytical methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) are needed to identify and quantify belowground C. The use of GPR has been well characterized across geological, archaeological, engineering, and military applications. While GPR has been predominantly utilized to detect relatively large objects such as rocks, tree roots, land mines, and peat soils, the objective of this study was to quantify comparatively smaller, particulate sources of SOC. This research used three materials as C sources: biochar, graphite, and activated C. The C sources were mixed with sand-12 treatments in total-and scanned under three moisture levels: 0\%, 10\%, and 20\% to simulate different soil conditions. GPR attribute analyses and Naive Bayes predictive models were utilized in lieu of visualization methods because of the minute size of the C particles. Significant correlations between GPR attributes and both C content and moisture levels were detected. The accuracy of two predictive models using a Naive Bayes classifier for C content was trivial but the accuracy for C structure was 56\%. The analyses confirmed the ability of GPR to identify differences in both C content and C structure. Beneficial future applications could focus on applying GPR across more diverse soil conditions.},

	abstract = {Diffusion through graphs can be used to model many real-world processes, such as the spread of diseases, social network memes, computer viruses, or water  contaminants. Often, a real-world diffusion cannot be directly observed while it  is occurring - perhaps it is not noticed until some time has passed, continuous  monitoring is too costly, or privacy concerns limit data access. This leads to  the need to reconstruct how the present state of the diffusion came to be from  partial diffusion data. Here, we tackle the problem of reconstructing a diffusion  history from one or more snapshots of the diffusion state. This ability can be  invaluable to learn when certain computer nodes are infected or which people are  the initial disease spreaders to control future diffusions. We formulate this  problem over discrete-time SEIRS-type diffusion models in terms of maximum  likelihood. We design methods that are based on submodularity and a novel  prize-collecting dominating-set vertex cover (PCDSVC) relaxation that can  identify likely diffusion steps with some provable performance guarantees. Our  methods are the first to be able to reconstruct complete diffusion histories  accurately in real and simulated situations. As a special case, they can also  identify the initial spreaders better than the existing methods for that problem.  Our results for both meme and contaminant diffusion show that the partial  diffusion data problem can be overcome with proper modeling and methods, and that  hidden temporal characteristics of diffusion can be predicted from limited data.},

This article presents an archaeo-historic epidemiological modelling study of Rift Valley fever (RVF), using data-driven neural network technology. RVF affects both human and animal populations, can rapidly decimate herds causing catastrophic economic hardship, and is identified as a Category A biodefense pathogen by the US Center for Disease Control. Despite recent origins circa the early 1900s, little is known about the circumstances of its inception nor the relationships between factors that affect transmission. This evidence could be vital as the disease continues to expand from its epicentre in Kenya to other parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVF is a relevant case for archaeological/palaeopathological investigations of disease as it intersects between numerous human, animal, spatial, temporal, and sociopolitical dimensions. By integrating landscape archaeology, historical evidence, and climatic data, with evidence of human behaviour gathered through ethnoarchaeological study, this article presents an applied framework for human-animal palaeopathology. This framework aligns with the One Health approach that observes disease to be intrinsically tied to ecological and societal factors. We provide a useable alternative way of thinking about disease modelling in the present and the past, ultimately seeking to support efforts to accurately predict future impacts. Tapping into longitudinal evidence from the last 50-300 years offers a powerful way to respond to the threat zoonoses will pose to human populations around the world as the climate warms.},

	abstract = {The complete assessment of landslide susceptibility needs uniformly distributed detailed information on the territory. This information, which is related to the temporal occurrence of landslide phenomena and their causes, is often fragmented and heterogeneous. The present study evaluates the landslide susceptibility map of the Natural Archaeological Park of Matera (Southern Italy) (Sassi and area Rupestrian Churches sites). The assessment of the degree of "spatial hazard" or "susceptibility" was carried out by the spatial prediction regardless of the return time of the events. The evaluation model for the susceptibility presented in this paper is very focused on the use of innovative techniques of artificial intelligence such as Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and Neuro-fuzzy Network. The method described in this paper is a novel technique based on a neuro-fuzzy system. It is able to train data like neural network and it is able to shape and control uncertain and complex systems like a fuzzy system. This methodology allows us to derive susceptibility maps of the study area. These data are obtained from thematic maps representing the parameters responsible for the instability of the slopes. The parameters used in the analysis are: plan curvature, elevation (DEM), angle and aspect of the slope, lithology, fracture density, kinematic hazard index of planar and wedge sliding and toppling. Moreover, this method is characterized by the network training which uses a training matrix, consisting of input and output training data, which determine the landslide susceptibility. The neuro-fuzzy method was integrated to a sensitivity analysis in order to overcome the uncertainty linked to the used membership functions. The method was compared to the landslide inventory map and was validated by applying three methods: a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, a confusion matrix and a SCAI method. The developed neuro-fuzzy method showed a good performance in the determination of the landslide susceptibility map.},

While traditional water search methods have generally involved  using dive teams, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and water scent dogs for  cases involving submerged objects and bodies, law enforcement is increasingly  integrating multiple methods that include geophysical technologies. There are  numerous advantages for integrating geophysical technologies, such as side scan  sonar and ground penetrating radar (GPR), with more traditional search methods.  Overall, these methods decrease the time involved searching, in addition to  increasing area searched. However, as with other search methods, there are  advantages and disadvantages when using each method. For example, in instances  with excessive aquatic vegetation or irregular bottom terrain, it may not be  possible to discern a submersed body with side scan sonar. As a result, forensic  personnel will have the highest rate of success during searches for submerged  objects when integrating multiple search methods, including deploying multiple  geophysical technologies. The goal of this paper is to discuss the methodology of  various search methods that are employed for submerged objects and how these  various methods can be integrated as part of a comprehensive protocol for water  searches depending upon the type of underwater terrain. In addition, two  successful case studies involving the search and recovery of a submerged human  body using side scan sonar are presented to illustrate the successful application  of integrating a geophysical technology with divers when searching for a  submerged object.},

Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models constructed with device-specific portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) source catalogs benefit from the precision of individual pXRF machines and the ability of PLS-DA to handle highly correlated data sets to provide a source classification system that complements existing methods. Of the known obsidian sources in or near Southeast Alaska, four are identified in early Holocene archaeological assemblages: Obsidian Cove and Aguada Cove on Suemez Island, Mount Edziza in the Coast Mountain Range, and a newly identified source on Zim Creek, Kupreanof Island. A comprehensive reanalysis of early Holocene microblade cores (101 cores from 13 archaeological sites) across Southeast Alaska confirms the presence of exotic obsidian from Mount Edziza in one of the oldest sites, alongside possible evidence of landscape learning: testing of the obsidian source on Kupreanof Island. The dominance of the Obsidian Cove source for microblade core production supports hypotheses framing Northwest Coast microblade core morphology as an adaptation to the small nodules of raw material available at the source. A simple distance-decay model indicates no relationship between core reduction intensity and distance from the source, suggesting high forager mobility characterized by regular trips to Suemez Island (a voyage of up to 380 km) throughout the early Holocene.},

Based on a deep-learning technique for post-mortem interval approach (ranging from 1 day up to 2000 years) an estimation of post-mortem interval with an accuracy of almost 100\% in bones is possible.
Estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI) of human skeletal remains is a critical issue of forensic analysis, with important limitations such as sample preparation and practicability. In this work, NIR spectroscopy (NIRONE (R) Sensor X; Spectral Engines, 61449, Germany) was applied to estimate the PMI of 104 human bone samples between 1 day and 2000 years. Reflectance data were repeatedly collected from eight independent spectrometers between 1950 and 1550 nm with a spectral resolution of 14 nm and a step size of 2 nm, each from the external and internal bone. An Artificial Neural Network was used to analyze the 66,560 distinct diagnostic spectra, and clearly distinguished between forensic and archaeological bone material: the classification accuracies for PMIs of 0-2 weeks, 2 weeks-6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1 year-10 years, and {\textgreater}100 years were 0.90, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93, and 1.00, respectively. PMI of archaeological bones could be determined with an accuracy of 100\%, demonstrating the adequate predictive performance of the model. Applying a handheld NIR spectrometer to estimate the PMI of human skeletal remains is rapid and extends the repertoire of forensic analyses as a distinct, novel approach.},

Availability of electronic imaging tools and  effective image processing techniques makes it feasible to process the multimedia  data in large databases. In this paper, a framework for content-based retrieval  of historical documents in the Ottoman Empire archives is presented. The  documents are stored as textual images, which are compressed by constructing a  library of symbols occurring in a document, and the symbols in the original image  are then replaced with pointers into the codebook to obtain a compressed  representation of the image. The features in wavelet and spatial domain based on  angular and distance span of shapes are used to extract the symbols. In order to  make content-based retrieval in historical archives, a query is specified as a  rectangular region in an input image and the same symbol-extraction process is  applied to the query region. The queries are processed on the codebook of  documents and the query images are identified in the resulting documents using  the pointers in textual images. The querying process does not require  decompression of images. The new content-based retrieval framework is also  applicable to many other document archives using different scripts.},

In 1999, Murail and co-authors proposed an approach, which they called "secondary sex diagnosis," consisting in using those individuals whose pelvic sex could be estimated as a reference sample for the extrapelvic sex estimation of the other individuals. The computational use of this approach may be cumbersome when dealing with very fragmented material and implies many heavily repetitive tasks if performed manually. rdss is an R package with a graphical user interface that facilitates all the steps of the so-called secondary sex diagnosis and allows an easy assessment of the quality and relevance of the statistical models built and used during this process. In the present article, a small subset of the freely available online Goldman Data Set is used to illustrate the use of this package on real osteometric data, and some methodological caveats that regularly arise with archeological samples are discussed.

Using compiled archaeological data and a suite of environmental variables, we generate an ensemble species distribution model (SDM) that incorporates general additive models, random forest models and Maxent models to reconstruct spatial patterns of pre-Columbian people that inhabited the Tropical Andes east of the continental divide, within the modern countries of Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. Within this region, here referred to as the eastern Andean flank, elevation, mean annual cloud frequency, distance to rivers and precipitation of the driest quarter are the environmental variables most closely related to human occupancy. Our model indicates that 11.04\% of our study area (65 368 km(2)) was likely occupied by pre-Columbian people. Our model shows that 30 of 351 forest inventory plots, which are used to generate ecological understanding of Andean ecosystems, were likely occupied in the pre-Columbian period. In previously occupied sites, successional trajectories may still be shaping forest dynamics, and those forests may still be recovering from the ecological legacy of pre-Columbian impacts. Our ensemble SDM links palaeo- and neo-ecology and can also be used to guide both future archaeological and ecological studies.

Although used abundantly to justify our interest in ancient societies, this statement lacks practical meaning due to the high degree of uncertainty which cloaks archaeological studies and theories, and the fact that there is no real way to prove or validate them. That is why it is so important to approach this study from a multidisciplinary point of view, providing several inputs which complement each other and so maximize the amount of factual information drawn from the analysis. Even then, the study will never be truly complete because there will always be a missing document, a small trace of an object (Verhagen, 2008), that still needs to be analysed.
This paper aims to be a useful contribution to historical research, specifically to the study of architectural history. Its purpose is to create a series of methods and tools for testing and analysing theories and hypotheses for historical scenarios (Vasaros, 2008) through the use of 3D modelling tools and Virtual Reality (VR) engines.
The project was developed in two stages:
The first was the creation of several three-dimensional (3D) models, each representing a different theory or hypothesis. The models were based on accurate Computer Assisted Design (CAD) (Autodesk (R) AutoCAD) models for the reconstruction of the buildings, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ESRI (R)) for the recreation of the terrain, thereby creating a realistic representation of what exists now, and a close approximation to what may have once existed.
In the second stage, a simplified version of the models was imported into a Virtual Reality (VR) game engine (Bethesda Softworks (R)) to create the ambience of the villa at the time, allowing full exploration of the space. It also includes fauna and flora, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven avatars, as can be seen in the Video 1 provided in the electronic version of this manuscript. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We present an approach for fossil pollen analysis that uses optical  superresolution microscopy and machine learning to create a quantitative and  higher throughput workflow for producing palynological identifications and  hypotheses of biological affinity. We developed three convolutional neural  network (CNN) classification models: maximum projection (MPM), multislice (MSM),  and fused (FM). We trained the models on the pollen of 16 genera of the legume  tribe Amherstieae, and then used these models to constrain the biological  classifications of 48 fossil Striatopollis specimens from the Paleocene, Eocene,  and Miocene of western Africa and northern South America. All models achieved  average accuracies of 83 to 90\% in the classification of the extant genera, and  the majority of fossil identifications (86\%) showed consensus among at least two  of the three models. Our fossil identifications support the paleobiogeographic  hypothesis that Amherstieae originated in Paleocene Africa and dispersed to South  America during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma). They also raise the  possibility that at least three Amherstieae genera (Crudia, Berlinia, and  Anthonotha) may have diverged earlier in the Cenozoic than predicted by molecular  phylogenies.},

This handedness is due to the lateralization of the cerebral hemispheres and is controlled by brain areas involved in complex motor tasks such as making stone tools or in language. In addition to describing the evolution of laterality in humans, identifying hand preference in fossil hominids can improve our understanding of the emergence and development of complex cognitive faculties during evolution. Several fields of prehistory like palaeoanthropology or lithic analysis have already investigated handedness in fossils hominins but they face limitations due to either the incomplete or the composite state of the skeleton remains or to results replication or method application failure. Wear analysis could provide new complementary data about hand preference evolution and the development of certain complex cognitive functions using indirect evidence (use traces, micro-scars in particular) of the hand holding the stone tool during use. Controlled experiment has been carried out in order to establish a reference collection of tools used with the left and tools used with the right hand. Wear analysis was performed on this corpus using "classical" microscopic approach and geometric morphometric analysis. A machine learning algorithm, the k-NN method, was applied to verify if use traces (micro-scars) could help determine the hand holding the tool during use. The best model, based on parameters referring to invasiveness of micro-scars, was able to correctly determine the hand holding the tool with 75\% accuracy.},

The algorithms search for associations of haplogroups jointly propagating in a significant subset of these populations. Joint propagations of Hgs are detected directly by similar ranking lists of populations derived from Hg frequencies of the 50 Hg distributions. The method provides us the most characteristic associations of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups, and the set of populations where these associations propagate jointly. In addition, the typical ranking lists characterizing these Hg associations show the geographical distribution, the probable place of origin and the paths of their protection.

Now that several taphonomic techniques allow identifying carnivore modification of bones, a next step involves determining carnivore type. This is of utmost importance to determine which carnivores were preying on and competing with hominins and what types of interaction existed among them during prehistory. Computer vision techniques using deep architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significantly higher resolution in the identification of bone surface modifications (BSM) than previous methods. Here, we apply these techniques to test the hypothesis that different carnivores create specific BSM that can enable their identification. To make differentiation more challenging, we selected two types of carnivores (lions and jaguars) that belong to the same mammal family and have similar dental morphology. We hypothesize that if two similar carnivores can be identified by the BSM they imprint on bones, then two more distinctive carnivores (e.g. hyenids and felids) should be more easily distinguished. The CNN method used here shows that tooth scores from both types of felids can be successfully classified with an accuracy greater than 82\%. The first hypothesis was successfully tested. The next step will be to differentiate diverse carnivore types involving a wider range of carnivore-made BSM. The present study demonstrates that resolution increases when combining two different disciplines (taphonomy and artificial intelligence computing) in order to test new hypotheses that could not be addressed with traditional taphonomic methods.},

From this perspective, we intend to present a complete framework solution for the task of video summarization and object detection in underwater videos. We employed a perceived motion energy (PME) method to first extract the keyframes followed by an object detection model approach namely YoloV3 to perform object detection in underwater videos. The issues of blurriness and low contrast in underwater images are also taken into account in the presented approach by applying the image enhancement method. Furthermore, the suggested framework of underwater video summarization and object detection has been evaluated on a publicly available brackish dataset. It is observed that the proposed framework shows good performance and hence ultimately assists several marine researchers or scientists related to the field of underwater archaeology, stock assessment, and surveillance.},

Acquiring representative, high quality data is the most important criterion to assess the value of any spatial analysis, however, there are many situations in which these criteria cannot be fulfilled. Archived data, collected in the past, for which analysis cannot be repeated or supplemented is a very common information source. Archaeological data collected at a regional extent during years of field work and superficial observations are an additional example. Such data rarely provide representative samples and are usually imbalanced; only very few examples contain useful data, while many examples remain without any archaeological traces. In spite of these limitations archaeological information presented in the form of maps can be a useful and helpful tool to analyse the spatial patterns of some phenomena and, from a more practical point of view, a tool to predict the location of undiscovered occurrences. The primary goal of this paper is to present a methodology for modelling spatial patterns based on imbalanced categorical data which do not fulfil the criteria of spatial representation and incorporates uncertainty in its decision process. This concept will be discussed using a collection of Stone Age sites and set of environmental variables from the postglacial lowlands in Western Poland. We will propose a machine-learning system which adopts CART through bootstrap simulation to incorporate uncertainty into the spatial model and utilise that uncertainty in the decision-making process. Finally, we will describe the relationships between the model and environmental variables and present our results in cartographic form using the principles of decision-tree cartography.},

In areas where numerous rock art sites exist, much of the rock art is unidentified and therefore remains, unrecorded and unresearched. Manually identifying rock art is time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to automate many processes in rock art research, which can be accomplished by Machine Learning. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can greatly facilitate rock art research in many ways, such as through Object Recognition and Detection, Motif Extraction, Object Reconstruction, Image Knowledge Graphs, and Representations. This article is a reflective work on the future of ML for rock art research. As a proof-of-concept, it presents a machine learning method based on recent advances in deep learning to train a model to identify images with painted rock art (pictograms). The efficacy of the proposed method is shown using data collected from fieldwork in Australia. Furthermore, our proposed method can be used to train models that are specific to the rock art found in different regions. We provide the code and the trained models in the supplementary section.},

	abstract = {Purpose By mapping-out the capabilities, challenges and limitations of named-entity recognition (NER), this article aims to synthesise the state of the art of NER in the context of the early modern research field and to inform discussions about the kind of resources, methods and directions that may be pursued to enrich the application of the technique going forward. Design/methodology/approach Through an extensive literature review, this article maps out the current capabilities, challenges and limitations of NER and establishes the state of the art of the technique in the context of the early modern, digitally augmented research field. It also presents a new case study of NER research undertaken by Enlightenment Architectures: Sir Hans Sloane's Catalogues of his Collections (2016-2021), a Leverhulme funded research project and collaboration between the British Museum and University College London, with contributing expertise from the British Library and the Natural History Museum. Findings Currently, it is not possible to benchmark the capabilities of NER as applied to documents of the early modern period. The authors also draw attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, leading them to the conclusion that more robust reporting and critical analysis of NER approaches and findings is required. Research limitations/implications This article examines NER as applied to early modern textual sources, which are mostly studied by Humanists. As addressed in this article, detailed reporting of NER processes and outcomes is not necessarily valued by the disciplines of the Humanities, with the result that it can be difficult to locate relevant data and metrics in project outputs. The authors have tried to mitigate this by contacting projects discussed in this paper directly, to further verify the details they report here. Practical implications The authors suggest that a forum is needed where tools are evaluated according to community standards. Within the wider NER community, the MUC and ConLL corpora are used for such experimental set-ups and are accompanied by a conference series, and may be seen as a useful model for this. The ultimate nature of such a forum must be discussed with the whole research community of the early modern domain. Social implications NER is an algorithmic intervention that transforms data according to certain rules-, patterns- or training data and ultimately affects how the authors interpret the results. The creation, use and promotion of algorithmic technologies like NER is not a neutral process, and neither is their output A more critical understanding of the role and impact of NER on early modern documents and research and focalization of some of the data- and human-centric aspects of NER routines that are currently overlooked are called for in this paper. Originality/value This article presents a state of the art snapshot of NER, its applications and potential, in the context of early modern research. It also seeks to inform discussions about the kinds of resources, methods and directions that may be pursued to enrich the application of NER going forward. It draws attention to the situated nature of authority files, and current conceptualisations of NER, and concludes that more robust reporting of NER approaches and findings are urgently required.

In twenty-first-century archaeology, scholars can rely on vastly improved technologies to aid them in these efforts toward public engagement, including digital photography, geographic information systems, and three-dimensional models. These technologies, even when collected for analysis or documentation, can be valuable tools for educating and involving the public with archaeological methods and how these methods help archaeologists learn about the past. Ultimately, academic storytelling can benefit from making archaeological results and methods accessible and engaging for stakeholders and the general public. ArcGIS StoryMaps is an effective tool for integrating digital datasets into an accessible framework that is suitable for interactive public engagement.

On the other hand, data mining in general and machine learning in particular have already inspired many disciplines to introduce new paradigms of data analysis and knowledge discovery.

To this end, we extensively discuss the concept of similarity and assess the suitability of machine learning techniques for the purposes of classification and typology development. Our methodology covers all steps starting from unordered, unlabelled objects to the emergence of a consistent and reusable typology. The application of this process is exemplarily illustrated by classifying the vessels from a Late Bronze Age cemetery in Eastern Saxony. Despite the individual character of these vessels, we achieved class prediction rates of more than 95\%. Such a success was only possible, because we permanently reconciled the output of the learning algorithms with our own expectations in order to identify and eliminate the systematic errors within the typology.},

RCHs are important historical landscape features created from the production of charcoal. RCHs are noted in Central Europe from the Medieval Period, but also are widespread near (pre-)industrial mining centers. Different forms of charcoal hearths were created by workers known as colliers, and their hearth building techniques may have differed on a regional scale. Our catalog is based on a morphologic-genetic grouping of RCHs. Due to topographic effects, reuse of production sites, or local techniques, this catalog is nonexhaustive, but most RCHs in Central Europe can be grouped into one of seven types.},

	abstract = {We measured delta O-18 values in modern and archaeological Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) otoliths recovered from Aialik Bay on the Pacific coast of the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, using a high precision ion microprobe. Values of delta O-18 were measured in as many as sixty 10-mu m spots along 2-3 mm transects from the otolith core to its margin with high spot-to-spot analytical precision (delta O-18 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand). We obtained sample densities along a linear transect that were at least 2 to 3 times greater than micromilling/conventional mass spectrometry techniques. From modern Pacific cod otoliths (using in situ temperatures from electronic archive tags) we calibrated an empirical fractionation equation of aragonite delta O-18 to sea water temperature (r(2) = 0.75, p {\textless} 0.001, delta O-18(A) = 2.13-0.25 T degrees C) and from which we predicted the thermography of fish life history and historic nearshore water temperature in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Sinuous variability of delta O-18 values along core-to-margin transects likely reflect seasonal temperature changes and suggest similar longevity between modern and archaeological cod. Generally increasing delta O-18 values from the otolith core region to the margin revealed an ontogenetic migration from warmer nearshore habitat during the first year of life to cooler deeper waters at later ages, a behavior that has not changed over the past 200 years. A decline in the average delta O-18 of otolith cores from archaeological (similar to 200 +, similar to 100 + years before present, YBP) to modern otoliths suggest increasing sea surface temperatures from the late Little Ice Age to present. Temperatures calculated from the delta O-18 in aragonite suggest a 2-3 degrees C rise in coastal marine sea surface temperatures in the GOA over the last 200 years. Implications of indigenous subsistence resource use and settlement patterns are discussed in light of major shifts in GOA water temperatures and biological regimes.},

Furthermore, vision-based approaches can cause errors, considering the complex types of de-terioration that develop in different scales and forms in monuments. This problem can be solved effec-tively owing to computer vision algorithms, commonly used in different areas nowadays. This study aims to develop a model that automatically detects and maps deteriorations (biological colonization, contour scaling, crack, higher plant, impact damage, microkarst, missing part) and restoration interventions using the Mask R-CNN algorithm, which has recently come to the fore with its feature of recognizing small and large-sized objects. To this end, a total of 2460 images of Yazilikaya monuments in the Hattusa archeo-logical site, which is on the UNESCO heritage list, were gathered. In the training phase of the proposed method, it was trained in model 1 to distinguish deposit deterioration commonly observed on the surface of monuments from other anomalies. Other anomalies trained were model 2. In this phase of the models, the average precision values with high accuracy rates ranging from 89.624\% to 100\% were obtained for the deterioration classes. The developed algorithms were tested on 4 different rock reliefs in Yazilikaya, which were not used in the training phase. In addition, an image of the Eflatunpinar water monument, which is on the UNESCO tentative list, was used to test the model's universality. According to the test results, it was determined that the models could be successfully applied to obtain maps of deterioration and restoration interventions in monuments in different regions.

The Creole are descendants of Europeans and enslaved Africans brought to Belize-a former British colony-for logging in the colonial period. Belizean history in schools focuses heavily on the ancient Maya, which is well documented archaeologically, but Creole history and culture remain largely undocumented and make up only a small component of the social studies curriculum.

	abstract = {Airborne LiDAR technology is widely used in archaeology and over the past decade has emerged as an accurate tool to describe anthropomorphic landforms. Archaeological features are traditionally emphasised on a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using multiple Visualisation Techniques (VTs), and occasionally aided by automated feature detection or classification techniques. Such an approach offers limited results when applied to heterogeneous structures (different sizes, morphologies), which is often the case for archaeological remains that have been altered throughout the ages. This study proposes to overcome these limitations by developing a multi-scale analysis of topographic position combined with supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). Rather than highlighting individual topographic anomalies, the multi-scalar approach allows archaeological features to be examined not only as individual objects, but within their broader spatial context. This innovative and straightforward method provides two levels of results: a composite image of topographic surface structure and a probability map of the presence of archaeological structures. The method was developed to detect and characterise megalithic funeral structures in the region of Carnac, the Bay of Quiberon, and the Gulf of Morbihan (France), which is currently considered for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a result, known archaeological sites have successfully been geo-referenced with a greater accuracy than before (even when located under dense vegetation) and a ground-check confirmed the identification of a previously unknown Neolithic burial mound in the commune of Carnac.},

However, parameter calibration is insufficient to conduct data-driven explorations that are adequate in evaluating the importance of causal factors that constitute agent rules that match real-world individual-scale generative behaviors. We introduce evolutionary model discovery, a framework that combines genetic programming and random forest regression to evaluate the importance of a set of causal factors hypothesized to affect the individual's decision-making process. With evolutionary model discovery, we investigated the farm plot seeking behavior of the Ancestral Pueblo of the Long House Valley simulated in the Artificial Anasazi model. We evaluated the importance of causal factors unconsidered in the original model, which we hypothesized to have affected the decision-making process. Our findings, concur with other archaeological studies on the Ancestral Pueblo communities during the Pueblo II period, which indicate the existence of cross-village polities, hierarchical organization, and dependence on the viability of the agricultural niche. Contrary to the original Artificial Anasazi model, where closeness was the sole factor driving farm plot selection, selection of higher quality land, distancing from failed farm plots, and desire for social presence are found to be more important. Finally, models updated with farm selection strategies designed by incorporating these insights showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over the original Artificial Anasazi model.},

	abstract = {Background: Biomolecular methods for species identification are increasingly being utilised in the study of changing environments, both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. High-throughput peptide mass fingerprinting has been largely applied to bacterial identification, but increasingly used to identify archaeological and palaeontological skeletal material to yield information on past environments and human-animal interaction. However, as applications move away from predominantly domesticate and the more abundant wild fauna to a much wider range of less common taxa that do not yet have genetically-derived sequence information, robust methods of species identification and biomarker selection need to be determined.
Results: Here we developed a supervised machine learning algorithm for classifying the species of ancient remains based on collagen fingerprinting. The aim was to minimise requirements on prior knowledge of known species while yielding satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm uses iterations of a modified random forest classifier with a similarity scoring system to expand its identified samples. We tested it on a set of 6805 spectra and found that a high level of accuracy can be achieved with a training set of five identified specimens per taxon.
Conclusions: This method consistently achieves higher accuracy than two-dimensional principal component analysis and similar accuracy with hierarchical clustering using optimised parameters, which greatly reduces requirements for human input. Within the vertebrata, we demonstrate that this method was able to achieve the taxonomic resolution of family or sub-family level whereas the genus- or species-level identification may require manual interpretation or further experiments. In addition, it also identifies additional species biomarkers than those previously published.},

The current paper employs a quantitative  analytical framework based upon the use of neural networks to examine changing  constellations of technologies between MSA and LSA assemblages from eastern  Africa. Network ensembles were trained to differentiate LSA assemblages from  Marine Isotope Stage 3\&4 MSA and Marine Isotope Stage 5 MSA assemblages based  upon the presence or absence of 16 technologies. Simulations were used to extract  significant indicator and contra-indicator technologies for each assemblage  class. The trained network ensembles classified over 94\% of assemblages  correctly, and identified 7 key technologies that significantly distinguish  between assemblage classes.

Looting is also understood to generate revenue, but systematic analysis of this issue is challenged by its opacity: how can we study the economic effects of archaeological looting when the practice is rarely directly observable? To address this problem, we estimate the market value of archaeological sites where artifacts have been previously excavated and documented, using a machine-learning approach. The first step uses 41,587 sales of objects from 33 firms to train an algorithm to predict the distribution channel, lot packaging, and estimated sale price of objects based on their observable characteristics. The second step uses the trained algorithm to estimate the value of sites in which a large number of artifacts have been legally excavated and documented. We make an out-of-sample prediction on two Syrian sites, Tell Bi'a and Dura Europos.},

With these preconditions, we evaluate the usability of pXRF geochemical data for the dating of archaeological sediments with machine learning techniques. The sample material was collected via sampling of archaeological sections and profile walls from archaeological excavations in the northwestern Nile delta at the settlement site Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) and Kom el-Gir. Additionally, samples were taken from sediments and cultural layers uncovered from their surroundings using vibracore corings with open steel auger heads. In this methodological approach, we examine the applicability of pXRF methods and test the sample data for distinct geochemical differences between the main settlement phases with multivariate statistical methods. The dating is based on the training of artificial neural networks with pXRF data from archaeological material of well-dated context to date test data of cultural layers within the vibracores. This allows us to link fundamental changes in the landscape with the settlement history of Buto and neighboring tells.},

While ground truth refers to a set of remote sensing practices, it has a longer history in operational photography, such as aerial reconnaissance. Building on a discussion of this history, this article argues that ground truth has shifted from a reference to the physical, geographical ground to the surface of the images echoing earlier points raised by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that there is a ground of the image that is central to the task of analysis beyond representational practices. Furthermore, building on the practices of pattern recognition, composite imaging, and different interpretational techniques, we discuss contemporary practices of machine learning that mobilizes geographical earth observation datasets for experimental purposes, including tests such as "fake geography" as well as artistic practices, to show how ground truth is operationalized in such contexts of AI and visual arts.},

	abstract = {Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used in diagnostics, clinical studies, and treatment planning. Automatic algorithms for image analysis have thus become an invaluable tool in medicine. Examples of this are two- and three-dimensional visualizations, image segmentation, and the registration of all anatomical structure and pathology types. In this context, we introduce Studierfenster (www.studierfenster.at): a free, non-commercial open science client-server framework for (bio-)medical image analysis. Studierfenster offers a wide range of capabilities, including the visualization of medical data (CT, MRI, etc.) in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space in common web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Other functionalities are the calculation of medical metrics (dice score and Hausdorff distance), manual slice-by-slice outlining of structures in medical images, manual placing of (anatomical) landmarks in medical imaging data, visualization of medical data in virtual reality (VR), and a facial reconstruction and registration of medical data for augmented reality (AR). More sophisticated features include the automatic cranial implant design with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the inpainting of aortic dissections with a generative adversarial network, and a CNN for automatic aortic landmark detection in CT angiography images. A user study with medical and non-medical experts in medical image analysis was performed, to evaluate the usability and the manual functionalities of Studierfenster. When participants were asked about their overall impression of Studierfenster in an ISO standard (ISO-Norm) questionnaire, a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points were achieved. The evaluation also provided insights into the results achievable with Studierfenster in practice, by comparing these with two ground truth segmentations performed by a physician of the Medical University of Graz in Austria. In this contribution, we presented an online environment for (bio-)medical image analysis. In doing so, we established a client-server-based architecture, which is able to process medical data, especially 3D volumes. Our online environment is not limited to medical applications for humans. Rather, its underlying concept could be interesting for researchers from other fields, in applying the already existing functionalities or future additional implementations of further image processing applications. An example could be the processing of medical acquisitions like CT or MRI from animals [Clinical Pharmacology \& Therapeutics, 84(4):448-456, 68], which get more and more common, as veterinary clinics and centers get more and more equipped with such imaging devices. Furthermore, applications in entirely non-medical research in which images/volumes need to be processed are also thinkable, such as those in optical measuring techniques, astronomy, or archaeology.},

Thus, determining the prehistoric emergence of this capacity is of  significant interest to understanding the uniqueness of the human animal. Tracing  that capacity chronologically is possible through archaeological investigations  that focus on physical markers that reflect "mortality salience." Among these  markers is the deliberate and culturally mediated disposal of corpses. Some  Neandertal bone assemblages are among the earliest reasonable claims for the  deliberate disposal of hominins, but even these are vigorously debated. More  dramatic assertions center on the Middle Pleistocene sites of Sima de los Huesos  (SH, Spain) and the Dinaledi Chamber (DC, South Africa), where the remains of  multiple hominin individuals were found in deep caves, and under reported  taphonomic circumstances that seem to discount the possibility that nonhominin  actors and processes contributed to their formation. These claims, with  significant implications for charting the evolution of the "human condition,"  deserve scrutiny. We test these assertions through machine-learning analyses of  hominin skeletal part representation in the SH and DC assemblages. Our results  indicate that nonanthropogenic agents and abiotic processes cannot yet be ruled  out as significant contributors to the ultimate condition of both collections.  This finding does not falsify hypotheses of deliberate disposal for the SH and DC  corpses, but does indicate that the data also support partially or completely  nonanthropogenic formational histories.},

Current archaeological research on cultigens emphasizes the protracted and intimate human interactions with wild species that defined paths to domestication and, with certain plants, profoundly impacted humanity. Tobacco arguably has had more impact on global patterns in history than any other psychoactive substance, but how deep its cultural ties extend has been widely debated. Excavations at the Wishbone site, directed at the hearth-side activities of the early inhabitants of North America's desert west, have uncovered evidence for human tobacco use approximately 12,300 years ago, 9,000 years earlier than previously documented. Here we detail the preservation context of the site, discuss its cultural affiliation and suggest ways that the tobacco may have been used. The find has implications for our understanding of deep-time human use of intoxicants and its sociocultural intersection with food crop domestication.},

We evaluate past uses of radar, multispectral, and LiDAR datasets in Northwest Belize across well-studied wetland field complexes that occur under different vegetation conditions. Next, we compare topographic products derived from LiDAR data commonly used for archaeology and geomorphology. Lastly, we train a machine learning algorithm to detect ancient canals with LiDAR data and test the algorithm on a newly rediscovered field system. The spatial resolution of any dataset must be sufficiently high (2-m or finer resolution) to detect most of these canals reliably. High resolution multispectral sensors can detect canals in open areas, but most wetland complexes are under dense tropical forest impenetrable to multispectral instruments. LiDAR data were the most useful due to the high spatial resolution (0.5-m) and the ability to penetrate canopy, but still have limitations under certain conditions. The intensity of the LiDAR returns with multispectral LiDAR systems can reveal differences in soil and vegetation between ancient canals and fields in places leveled by modern farmers. The algorithm successfully maps ancient canals but has many false positives in natural depressions and drainages. Although the machine learning approach tested here cannot be used on its own, we used it with the LiDAR visualizations to refine the canal estimates from previous studies, mapping nearly 50\% more canals in the Central Rio Bravo floodplain than originally published.},

Mouse models  are a key resource for disentangling such effects, because they offer myriad  tools for manipulating the genome in a controlled environment. Unfortunately,  phenotypic data are often obtained using laboratory-specific protocols, resulting  in self-contained datasets that are difficult to relate to one another for larger  scale analyses. To enable meta-analyses of morphological variation, particularly  in the craniofacial complex and brain, we created MusMorph, a database of  standardized mouse morphology data spanning numerous genotypes and developmental  stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E14.5, E15.5, E18.5, and adulthood. To  standardize data collection, we implemented an atlas-based phenotyping pipeline  that combines techniques from image registration, deep learning, and  morphometrics. Alongside stage-specific atlases, we provide aligned  micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations  (if available) for each specimen (N = 10,056). Our workflow is open-source to  encourage transparency and reproducible data collection.

Due to its cloud free capability,  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an ideal source of information on forest  dynamics in countries with near-constant cloud-cover. However, few studies have  investigated the use of SAR for forest cover estimation in landscapes with highly  sparse and fragmented forest cover. In this study, the potential use of L-band  SAR for forest cover estimation in two regions (Longford and Sligo) in Ireland is  investigated and compared to forest cover estimates derived from three national  (Forestry2010, Prime2, National Forest Inventory), one pan-European (Forest Map  2006) and one global forest cover (Global Forest Change) product. Two  machine-learning approaches (Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees) are  evaluated. Both Random Forests and Extremely Randomised Trees classification  accuracies were high (98.1-98.5\%), with differences between the two classifiers  being minimal ({\textless}0.5\%). Increasing levels of post classification filtering led to  a decrease in estimated forest area and an increase in overall accuracy of  SAR-derived forest cover maps. All forest cover products were evaluated using an  independent validation dataset. For the Longford region, the highest overall  accuracy was recorded with the Forestry2010 dataset (97.42\%) whereas in Sligo,  highest overall accuracy was obtained for the Prime2 dataset (97.43\%), although  accuracies of SAR-derived forest maps were comparable. Our findings indicate that  spaceborne radar could aid inventories in regions with low levels of forest cover  in fragmented landscapes. The reduced accuracies observed for the global and  pan-continental forest cover maps in comparison to national and SAR-derived  forest maps indicate that caution should be exercised when applying these  datasets for national reporting.},

	abstract = {Contemporary discourse points to the central role that heritage plays in the process of enabling groups of various cultural or ethnic background to strengthen their feeling of belonging and sharing in society. Safeguarding heritage is also valued highly in the priorities of the European Commission. As a result, there have been several long-term initiatives involving the digitisation, annotation and cataloguing of tangible cultural heritage in museums and collections. Specifically, for built heritage, a pressing challenge is that historical monuments such as buildings, temples, churches or city fortification infrastructures are hard to document due to their historic palimpsest; spatial transformations, actions of destruction, reuse of material, or continuous urban development that covers traces and changes the formal integrity and identity of a cultural heritage site. The ability to reason about a monument's form is crucial for efficient documentation and cataloguing. This paper presents a 3D digitisation workflow through the involvement of reality capture technologies for the annotation and structure analysis of built heritage with the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) for classification purposes. The presented workflow contributes a new approach to the identification of a building's architectural components (e.g., arch, dome) and to the study of the stylistic influences (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine) of building parts. In doing so this workflow can assist in tracking a building's history, identifying its construction period and comparing it to other buildings of the same period. This process can contribute to educational and research activities, as well as facilitate the automated classification of datasets in digital repositories for scholarly research in digital humanities.},

	abstract = {Long and complex sequences of intentional organic rich sediments accumulation known as fumiers can often be found in many caves and rock shelters used for herding activities since the Neolithic to current times in the Mediterranean basin. These are mainly composed of burnt animal dung and vegetal remains and are commonly interpreted as the result of livestock domestic occupations and stabling activities. The repetitive and systematic burning processes that occurred for cleaning these spaces provide different layers with different archaeosedimentary features (facies). Fumier facies imply different pre-burial conditions that may influence bone diagenetic processes. In this work, we study the changes occurring in mineral and organic components of bones included in different facies (reelaborated, burned, unburned) in El Mirador cave fumier using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). We have carried out an analysis of 47 bone remains from four different facies [a, r(m), tf and v] from archaeological levels dated from the second half of the 5th until the first half of the 2nd millennia cal B.C. We have used a total of 13 parameters through ATR-FTIR to discriminate facies differences through PCA and Machine Learning techniques. The results show differences in crystallinity, organic, and carbonates content between bone remains recovered from fumier facies. Our results demonstrate that burial environments that occur on fumier deposits affect bone components in different ways. Therefore, fumier facies can be differentiated from each other through the diagenetic parameters provided by bone assemblage, distinguishing those well preserved and, therefore, eligible for other types of analyses (isotopes, proteomics, lipids, etc.). Furthermore, Machine Learning can classify the facies through carbonates indices API, C/C, and BPI. This study is an important step towards understanding the taphonomic processes (formation and reelaboration) that occur in fumier sequence as a result of the multiple livestock activities developed in caves and rock shelters.},

However, the regional variables of large-scale gradients are only considered rarely. Also, settlement modelling applications are often impeded by fragmentary and error-prone datasets. Thus, in current-day Lithuania, in order to study the dynamics of settlement distributional rules, we implemented a modelling strategy that involves the use of statistical and machine learning methods with null model simulations and that is less affected by the incompleteness of datasets and the scales of variables. In this study, we used regional variables in order to test their usefulness while providing a general understanding of the large-scale processes that governed settlement distribution in prehistory. This study encompassed six time intervals between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages. The obtained results consisted of regional settlement predictive maps, estimations of random forest variable importance and performances of GAM models, as well as determinations of Besag's L-functions of settlement patterns and Euclidean distances between the regional variables at the settlement sites. We detected decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the settlement prediction maps and settlement patterns, declining variable importance and model performance, as well as increasing regional environmental diversity of the settlement sites. A marked manifestation of these trends was observed between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. This also corresponded to a major change in the constitution of the most important variables of the settlement distributions. We associate these findings with technological and lifestyle changes in the southern Baltic region, interpreting them as causing a roughening of the human adaptive landscape increasing the specificity, number and complexity of the settlement distributional rules. Our study revealed that, even for incomplete datasets and spatial autocorrelation, the application of advanced statistical/machine learning techniques was able to provide new insights into the processes that governed the socio-cultural evolution and spatial dynamics of humans in prehistory.},

To fill this gap, online tutorials and learning platforms are being developed to familiarize archaeologists and students with the potential of digital media for archaeological research practices. Given the essential pedagogical role of these platforms, their quality is deserving of deeper interrogation. Here, I review three major platforms offering tutorials on digital archaeology: the Programming Historian, Project MERCURY-SIMREC, and the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook. These are evaluated and compared based on their goals, design (intuitiveness, ease of use), accessibility (use of jargon, required prerequisite knowledge, software requirements), scope (target audience, range of skills addressed, targeted level of improvement), and efficiency (whether or not they achieve their intended goals). The review concludes with a road map contextualizing the current state of available resources in light of the wider state of digital archaeology, and it considers pathways toward future development.},

There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

As such, this study intended to generate population-specific  osteometric models for the estimation of sex with the femur and to compare the  accuracy of the models obtained through classical and machine-learning  classifiers. A set of 15 standard femoral measurements was acquired in a training  sample (100 females; 100 males) from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection  (University of Coimbra, Portugal) and models for sex classification were produced  with logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector  machines (SVM), and reduce error pruning trees (REPTree). Under cross-validation,  univariable sectioning points generated with REPTree correctly estimated sex in  60.0-87.5\% of cases (systematic error ranging from 0.0 to 37.0\%), while  multivariable models correctly classified sex in 84.0-92.5\% of cases (bias from  0.0 to 7.0\%). All models were assessed in a holdout sample (24 females; 34 males)  from the 21st Century Identified Skeletal Collection (University of Coimbra,  Portugal), with an allocation accuracy ranging from 56.9 to 86.2\% (bias from 4.4  to 67.0\%) in the univariable models, and from 84.5 to 89.7\% (bias from 3.7 to  23.3\%) in the multivariable models.

Then we turn to the question of labeling: how humans tell computers which words will relate to a given image. What is at stake in the way AI systems use these labels to classify humans, including by race, gender, emotions, ability, sexuality, and personality? Finally, we turn to the purposes that computer vision is meant to serve in our society-the judgments, choices, and consequences of providing computers with these capacities. Methodologically, we call this an archeology of datasets: studying the material layers of training images and labels, cataloguing the principles and values by which taxonomies are constructed, and analyzing how these taxonomies create the parameters of intelligibility for an AI system.

Cut mark identification and analysis is a fundamental component for archaeological investigation. Cut mark analysis, however, has been the root of great debates, with some authors claiming to have the oldest cut marks in or outside of Africa. If these marks were to truly be anthropic in nature, then the repercussions of these findings would produce a paradigm shift for our understanding of human evolution. Unfortunately, the majority of methods available for cut mark classification are namely qualitative in nature. Here we provide a new, highly powerful artificially intelligent neural network classification model that can be used to quantitatively and more objectively overcome these issues, using 3D digital microscopy, Deep Learning and Geometric Morphometrics to obtain up to 100\% accuracy in some cases.
Abstract The concept of equifinality is currently one of the largest issues in taphonomy, frequently leading analysts to erroneously interpret the formation and functionality of archaeological and paleontological sites. An example of this equifinality can be found in the differentiation between anthropic cut marks and other traces on bone produced by natural agents, such as that of sedimentary abrasion and trampling. These issues are a key component in the understanding of early human evolution, yet frequently rely on qualitative features for their identification. Unfortunately, qualitative data is commonly susceptible to subjectivity, producing insecurity in research through analyst experience. The present study intends to confront these issues through a hybrid methodological approach. Here, we combine Geometric Morphometric data, 3D digital microscopy, and Deep Learning Neural Networks to provide a means of empirically classifying taphonomic traces on bone. Results obtained are able to reach over 95\% classification, providing a possible means of overcoming taphonomic equifinality in the archaeological and paleontological register.},

Geometric Morphometrics are a powerful multivariate statistical toolset for the analysis of morphology. While typically used in the study of biological and anatomical variance, modern applications now incorporate these tools into a number of different fields of non-biological origin. Nevertheless, as with many fields of data science, Geometric Morphometric techniques are often impeded by issues concerning sample size. The present study thus evaluates a number of different computational learning algorithms for the augmentation of different datasets. Here we show how generative algorithms from Artificial Intelligence are able to produce highly realistic synthetic data; helping improve the quality of any statistical or predictive modelling applications that may follow.
The fossil record is notorious for being incomplete and distorted, frequently conditioning the type of knowledge that can be extracted from it. In many cases, this often leads to issues when performing complex statistical analyses, such as classification tasks, predictive modelling, and variance analyses, such as those used in Geometric Morphometrics. Here different Generative Adversarial Network architectures are experimented with, testing the effects of sample size and domain dimensionality on model performance. For model evaluation, robust statistical methods were used. Each of the algorithms were observed to produce realistic data. Generative Adversarial Networks using different loss functions produced multidimensional synthetic data significantly equivalent to the original training data. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks were not as successful. The methods proposed are likely to reduce the impact of sample size and bias on a number of statistical learning applications. While Generative Adversarial Networks are not the solution to all sample-size related issues, combined with other pre-processing steps these limitations may be overcome. This presents a valuable means of augmenting geometric morphometric datasets for greater predictive visualization.},

	abstract = {A methodological problem is inherent in any discussion of extraterrestrial engineering and its detectability: how to distinguish detection signatures of such astroengineering from "natural", non-intentional, albeit exotic, processes? In practice, searches for traces and manifestations of advanced technological civilizations have been reduced so far to searching for outliers in the allegedly well-known regularities expected from natural astrophysical sources. This procedure, however, is an epistemological minefield, for at least two reasons: (i) prior datasets on which the regularities are based might be contaminated by artefacts, and (ii) the procedure of computation of unobservable quantities usually contains the implicit assumption of the non-intentional nature of sources. In other words, we are facing a Catch-22-type problem: in order to prove the artificial nature of a source, we seemingly need to first assume that it is not artificial. In contrast to most problems in science, this one could possibly be aggravated, rather than reduced, with the progress of our scientific understanding. Some possible recourses, as well as directions for further work toward building a comprehensive methodology of the Dysonian SETI, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Archaeological steles having a rough surface due to long periods of weathering make recognizing the inscription difficult. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to extract reliefs for the inscription from a rough stele surface. Relief candidate segments are initially obtained by using a curvature-based method, which include not only actual reliefs but also noises such as dents and scratches. Then, relief segments are selected using a support vector machine classifier that is trained with various features extracted from relief candidate segments. While conventional methods using a single geometric feature easily fail to detect reliefs from the rough surface, the proposed method utilizes 79-dimensional features consisting of appearance-based, cross section-based, and local extrema-based characteristics of each candidate segment to determine whether the segment is relief or not. Using the proposed method, the inscription of the stele Musul-ojakbi made during the Silla Dynasty AD578 were completely recognized. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately extracts reliefs and achieves the highest performance on the rough stele data. The performance of the proposed method is about 8.95\% and 10.4\% higher than the best of the conventional methods in terms of the F1-score and the SIRI, respectively.},

Dating from the High Middle Ages, these sherds have been engraved with repeated patterns using a carved wooden wheel. The study of these engraved patterns allows archaeologists to better understand the diffusion of ceramic productions. In this paper, we present a method that classifies patterns of ceramic sherds by combining deep learning-based features extracted from some pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. A dataset composed of 888 digital patterns extracted from 3D scans of pottery sherds was used to evaluate our approach. The classification capacity of each CNN model was first assessed individually. Then, several combinations of common pooling methods using different classifiers were tested. The best result was obtained when features of the VGG19 and ResNet50 models were combined using Compact Bilinear Pooling (CBP) with a high classification rate of 95.23\%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Jigsaw puzzle algorithm is important as it can be applied to many areas such as biology, image editing, archaeology and incomplete crime-scene reconstruction. But, still, some problems exist in the process of practical application, for example, when there are a large number of similar objects in the puzzle fragments, the error rate will reach 30\%-50\%. When some fragments are missing, most algorithms fail to restore the images accurately. When the number of fragments of the jigsaw puzzle is large, efficiency is reduced. During the intelligent puzzle, mainly the Sum of Squared Distance Scoring (SSD), Mahalanobis Gradient Compatibility (MGC) and other metrics are used to calculate the similarity between the fragments. On the basis of these two measures, we put forward some new methods: 1. MGC is one of the most effective measures, but using MGC to reassemble the puzzle can cause an error image every 30 or 50 times, so we combine the Jaccard and MGC metric measure to compute the similarity between the image fragments, and reassemble the puzzle with a greedy algorithm. This algorithm not only reduces the error rate, but can also maintain a high accuracy in the case of a large number of fragments of similar objects. 2. For the lack of fragmentation and low efficiency, this paper uses a new method of SSD measurement and mark matrix, it is general in the sense that it can handle puzzles of unknown size, with fragments of unknown orientation, and even puzzles with missing fragments. The algorithm does not require any preset conditions and is more practical in real life. Finally, experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper improves not only the accuracy but also the efficiency of the operation.},

	abstract = {The objective of this project is to create a new implementation of a deep learning model that uses digital elevation data to detect shipwrecks automatically and rapidly over a large geographic area. This work is intended to apply a new methodology to the field of underwater archaeology. Shipwrecks represent a major resource to understand maritime human activity over millennia, but underwater archaeology is expensive, misappropriated, and hazardous. An automated tool to rapidly detect and map shipwrecks can therefore be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Additionally, more comprehensive and accurate shipwreck maps can help to prioritize site selection and plan excavation. The model is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data for the United States available from NOAA. The model uses transfer learning to compensate for a relatively small sample size and addresses a recurring problem that associated work has had with false positives by training the model both on shipwrecks and background topography. Results of statistical analyses conducted-ANOVAs and box and whisker plots-indicate that there are substantial differences between the morphologic characteristics that define shipwrecks vs. background topography, supporting this approach to addressing false positives. The model uses a YOLOv3 architecture and produced an F1 score of 0.92 and a precision score of 0.90, indicating that the approach taken herein to address false positives was successful.},

Educational researchers and designers are in need of approaches and theories that move beyond deterministic accounts about the utility of individual learning technologies, to connect theory, research and practice. Our research shows that in learning to distinguish between elements that are open to alteration through design and those that are not, educational designers gain deeper insights into the flows of matter, information and humans characteristic of productive networked learning environments. And this, in turn, gives rise to valued qualities of emergent learning activity in alignment with current theories about learning.

The pigments used in prehistoric paintings present high light sensitivity and rigorous scientific color degradation mapping is not usually undertaken in overall archaeological sites. Microfading spectrometry is a suitable technique for determining the light-stability of pigments found in rock art paintings in a non-destructive way. Spectral data can be transformed into colorimetric information following the recommendations published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage(CIE). The fading degree can be evaluated through the color changes produced, computing both color and chromatic differences. Microfading Tester (MFT) measurements on spot samples are time-consuming and difficult to materialize on-site. This paper presents the results of statistical Gaussian process interpolation to map the potential MFT spectral variations overtime on a scene full of prehistoric rock art paintings. In addition, a descriptive analysis of color variations that may suffer the rock art motifs overtime has been carried out. The advanced statistical methodology implemented can highlight potential changes on some rock support areas, and stable conditions on the painted red motifs over time, which can help to establish future conservation actions in the archaeological site.

In this study, we carried out a comprehensive study of chronology, absolute and relative paleointensity on a late Neolithic site in central China. Ages of the samples are constrained to be similar to 3,500-3,000 BCE, a period when available paleointensity data are sparse. We present a total of 64 high-fidelity absolute paleointensities, demonstrating the field varied quickly from similar to 55 to similar to 90 ZAm(2) between similar to 3,500-3,000 BCE. Our results record a new archeomagnetic jerk around 3,300 BCE, which is probably non-dipolar origin. The new results provide robust constraints on global geomagnetic models. We calculated a revised Chinese archeointensity reference curve for future application. The variations of absolute and relative paleointensity versus depth show good consistency, reinforcing the reliability of our results. This new attempt of combining absolute and relative paleointenstiy provides a useful tool for future archeomagnetic research.
Plain Language Summary The geomagnetic field is generated in the Earth's liquid outer core; its behavior can provide us information on the Earth's interior and help us understand processes deep in the planet we live on. The magnetic field surrounds the Earth and acts like an umbrella protecting the planet from strong solar winds, and thus the geomagnetic behavior can affect life on the Earth. Understanding the evolution of the geomagnetic field allows us to learn about the Earth in the past and can help us predict what will happen in the future. The geomagnetic field includes both dipolar and non-dipolar components, with the former related to global and the latter to regional features. Studying regional geomagnetic variations from different areas is essential for outlining regional features and global distributions of the field. In this study, we carried out archeomagnetic research on a late Neolithic archeological site in central China. The high-fidelity results fill a gap of the present data set in both space and time, and thus refine both the regional and global geomagnetic models significantly. The newly released Chinese archeointensity reference curve in this study can be used for regional geomagnetic comparison as well as for archeological dating in this region.},

Artificial intelligence systems can model information with a degree of uncertainty and are associated with material degradation processes and risky external hazards subjected to seasonality. This method has allowed a systematic assessment of the shelters at the Complutum archaeological site (Spain). The system has been applied twice a day during the summer, autumn, winter and spring seasons, taking into consideration atmospheric and en-vironmental input variables and vulnerabilities in the shelter design and management. By providing the model predictions, specific preventive conservation measures could be taken in advance to avoid further damage or failures.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Their peculiarities are due to their roles as both a technological objective and in the management of core convexities to retain its geometric properties during reduction. In Middle Paleolithic con-texts, these backed implements are commonly produced during Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences. Backed products from Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences often show common geometric and morphological features that complicate their attribution to one of these methods. This study examines the identification of experimentally produced discoidal and recurrent centripetal Levallois backed products (including all stages of reduction) based on their morphological features. 3D geometric morphometrics are employed to quantify morphological variability among the experimental sample. Dimensionality reduction though principal component analysis is combined with 11 machine learning models for the identification of knapping methods. A supported vector machine with polynomial kernel has been identified as the best model (with a general accuracy of 0.76 and an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.8). This indicates that combining geometric morphometrics, principal component analysis, and machine learning models succeeds in capturing the morphological differences of backed products according to the knapping method.},

Predicting original flake mass allows for researchers to make estimations of remaining mass, lost mass, and other features. All these measures relate to the organization of lithic technology by past societies. The present work tests three different models to predict log of flake mass: multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Estimations of flake mass were performed using the remaining features of flakes from an experimental assemblage. This assemblage was obtained by the expansion of a previous dataset through the inclusion of bigger flakes, allowing the analysis to account for the effects of sample size and value distribution. Correlation results show a large/strong relation between predictions and real outcome (r(2) = 0.78 in the best case). Comparison of the models affords insights into variable importance for predicting flake mass. Results show that (for the present dataset) multiple linear regression still stands as the best method for predicting log of flake weight. Additionally, transformation of predicted values from the multiple linear regression and true values to the linear scale reinforces the linear correlation above the 0.8 threshold.},

The data set contains ancient Maya structures that were manually labeled, and ground verified to a large extent. We have built and compared two deep learning-based models, U-Net and Mask R-CNN, for semantic segmentation. The segmentation models were used in two tasks: identification of areas of ancient construction activity, and identification of the remnants of ancient Maya buildings. The U-Net based model performed better in both tasks and was capable of correctly identifying 60-66\% of all objects, and 74-81\% of medium sized objects. The quality of the resulting prediction was evaluated using a variety of quantifiers. Furthermore, we discuss the problems of re-purposing the archaeological style labeling for production of valid machine learning training sets. Ultimately, we outline the value of these models for archaeological research and present the road map to produce a useful decision support system for recognition of ancient objects in LiDAR data.},

Here we explore the relative importance of different components in sexing  two-dimensional foot impressions namely, size, shape and texture. We use a  machine learning approach and compare this to more traditional methods of  discrimination. Two datasets are used, a pilot data set collected from students  at Bournemouth University (N = 196) and a larger data set collected by  podiatrists at Sheffield NHS Teaching Hospital (N = 2677). Our convolutional  neural network can sex a footprint with accuracy of around 90\% on a test set of N  = 267 footprint images using all image components, which is better than an expert  can achieve. However, the quality of the impressions impacts on this success  rate, but the results are promising and in time it may be possible to create an  automated screening algorithm in which practitioners of whatever sort (medical or  forensic) can obtain a first order sexing of a two-dimensional footprint.},

Given the potential  for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and  increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances  in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel  approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of  historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to  determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in  semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and  wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment  re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of  individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have  a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day  conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought. Our approach  has great potential for estimating future landscape sensitivity to climate and  land use scenarios across a wide range of potentially fragile dryland  environments.},

Yet what is oftentimes overlooked is attention to the production sequence used to create motifs, and what this can reveal about the social and cultural behaviour of artists. Where it is evident that a particular group of motifs contains a wide range of individual design conventions, questions about why and how these choices were made become points of enquiry that have the potential to develop new insights into their symbolic and relational character, and cultural significance. To address this challenge, we undertook an investigation of the rare and highly distinctive Painted Hand rock art style from western Arnhem Land (Northern Territory, Australia). Using a quantitative, systematic, style-based analysis, and an ethnographic exploration of a select group of distinctive design conventions, we show how the decisions made by artists to use specific design conventions were not random but instead were deeply implicated in, and shaped by, social processes acquired through learning or enculturation.},

	abstract = {Following floods experienced in southwestern Alberta in June 2013, 36 palaeoenvironmental sediment samples were collected from the banks of four affected streams: the Kananaskis River, Highwood River, Tongue Creek and Jumping-pound Creek. The sampled layers were deposited during the Holocene, and provide evidence of riparian ecology in the region since the end of the last glacial interval. The samples were processed to extract sub-fossil macroremains (including seeds, fruits, and aquatic and terrestrial mollusc shells). Macrofossils are particularly useful for creating fine-resolution (site-specific) reconstructions. An innovative aspect of this study was the derivation of regional bioclimatic trends through time. This was achieved by applying a dual-layered weighted calibration function which incorporated the relative productivity of indicator taxa, their modelled climatic optima, and the influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on their ecological niche. Optima and climatic influence values were calculated using the machine-learning maximum entropy environmental niche modelling tool, MAXENT, trained on global occurrence records for the taxa. This study aimed to address gaps in prior palaeoenvironmental research, allowing for a spatially explicit quantitative reconstruction of climate in the transitional foothill region near Calgary. Results indicated warm conditions immediately following glacial retreat, followed by an early to mid-Holocene cooling which coincided with the driest interval. Temperature and moisture regimes oscillated in the mid-Holocene, exhibiting the highest values for both parameters. Increased moisture was at least in part prompted by increased input from summer glacial meltwater (the result of higher summer temperatures) which added to the riparian water budget. The mid-to late Holocene, and up to modern times, showed a gradual decrease in both moisture and temperature, until stabilizing near the Holocene average.},

The algorithms are particularly suited toward rapid identification and classification of archaeological features and objects. The results of these new studies include identification of many new sites around the world and improved classification of large archaeological datasets. ML fits well with more traditional methods used in archaeological analysis, and it remains subject to both the benefits and difficulties of those approaches. Small datasets associated with archaeological work make ML vulnerable to hidden complexity, systemic bias, and high validation costs if not managed appropriately. ML's scalability, flexibility, and rapid development, however, make it an essential part of twenty-first-century archaeological practice. This review briefly describes what ML is, how it is being used in archaeology today, and where it might be used in the future for archaeological purposes.},

The proposed method was developed  and evaluated using 389 femurs, 412 tibias, and 404 humeri of adult individuals  from a modern Greek reference sample, the Athens Collection. The skeletal  properties, which were extracted with the CSG-Toolkit, were analyzed with  step-wise DFA (evaluated with LOOCV) and subsequently with RBF kernel SVM  supervised learning. SVM cross-validation was based on a 20-fold stratified  random sample splitting as well as a chronological split based on year of birth  to further assess the effect of secular change in sex estimation capacity.  Maximum cross-validated classification accuracy from step-wise DFA reached 94.8\%  for the femur, 94.7\% for the tibia, and 97.3\% for the humerus, whereas SVM  cross-validated results were similar although slightly lower, mainly due to the  more strict cross-validation scheme. Our results suggest that the proposed sex  estimation method is reasonably robust to secular change, since there was limited  loss in classification accuracy between different chronological groups, despite  the presence of secular change in stature of the Greek population during the  examined period. The proposed method has been implemented as a function for the  GNU Octave environment, named estimate\_sex, which comprises a self-intuitive  graphical user interface for facilitating sex estimation and is freely available  under a suitable license.},

The proposed method was developed and evaluated using two  European population samples, a Czech sample comprising 170 crania reconstructed  from anonymized CT scans and a Greek sample of 156 crania from the Athens  Collection. It is based on a fully automatic algorithm applied on 3D models for  extracting sex diagnostic morphometric features which are further processed by  computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Classification accuracy was  evaluated in a population specific and a population generic 2-way  cross-validation scheme. Population-specific accuracy for individual morphometric  features ranged from 78.5 to 96.7\%, whereas population generic correct  classification ranged from 71.7 to 90.8\%. Combining all sex diagnostic traits in  multi-feature sex estimation yielded correct classification performance in excess  of 91\% for the entire sample, whereas the sex of about three fourths of the  sample could be determined with 100\% accuracy according to posterior probability  estimates. The proposed method provides an efficient and reliable way to estimate  sex from cranial remains, and it offers significant advantages over existing  methods.

It was used for lighting, heating, processing food and other materials, cooking and protection, and also possessed social and ritual significance. Hearths are one of the most common features at archaeological sites, but very often little attention is paid to the question of how these fires were lit, and they are seldom reflected in the archaeological record. In order to produce fire by percussion, an intermediate material is required between the sparks and the fuel. Fruiting bodies of fungi are a potential form of tinder, but are less inclined to be well-preserved than other materials.

	abstract = {Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource.},

It will also shed light on how the site of Bat is perceived by the local community and visitors.
Design/methodology/approach The archaeological complex of Bat, al-Khutm, and al-Ayn was listed by the UNESCO as a world heritage site in 1988. Despite this classification, relatively little attention has been given to the management of this site. The author conducted interviews with representatives of the MHC in order to understand how this site is being managed, and the author uploaded an online public questionnaire to learn how the population is being educated about the importance of this heritage.
Findings The results of this investigation revealed a surprisingly high level of public awareness about the importance of this site to the country socially, and economically. In spite of this awareness, the site is not visited frequently because it is not adequately equipped: a situation that was clearly outlined by the respondents. Suggestions were proposed in order to better integrate this site into the local development plans and the socio-economic growth of the whole region.
Originality/value The originality of this research is that it took the site of investigation an archaeological site listed by the UNESCO for its outstanding universal value and contrary to what is expected, this site was forgotten in all development and management plans executed by the local and central government for almost two decades. It is also the first research about a site in Oman to address such issues and use these methods.},

This is particularly true in the archaeological context where information concerning the discovery location of objects allows one to derive important relations between findings of a specific survey or even of different surveys, and time aspects extend from the excavation time, to the dating of archaeological objects. In recent years, several attempts have been performed to develop a spatio-temporal information system tailored for archaeological data.The first aim of this paper is to propose a model, called tar, for representing spatio-temporal data in archaeology. In particular, since in this domain dates are often subjective, estimated and imprecise, tar has to incorporate such vague representation by using fuzzy dates and fuzzy relationships among them. Moreover, besides to the topological relations, another kind of spatial relations is particularly useful in archeology: the stratigraphic ones. Therefore, this paper defines a set of rules for deriving temporal knowledge from the topological and stratigraphic relations existing between two findings. Finally, considering the process through which objects are usually manually dated by archeologists, some existing automatic reasoning techniques may be successfully applied to guide such process. For this purpose, the last contribution regards the translation of archaeological temporal data into a Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network for checking the overall data consistency and reducing the vagueness of some dates based on their relationships with other ones.},

	abstract = {It has previously been assumed that New England high-country environments were not conducive to intense Aboriginal occupation and associated ceremonial activities. How productive were upland wetlands (lagoons) for Aboriginal occupation of high country in eastern Australia through time? Especially during their intermittent phases, upland lagoons provide a diverse and changing mix of deep water, marsh and the green pick of recently exposed lake bed, a rich aggregation of both plant and animal resources not available in other environments. Upland wetlands can be a surprisingly productive Aboriginal resource in an otherwise harsh country, and would at times allow for high population aggregations, such as for ceremonies. We surveyed the ecological literature on New England lagoon characteristics, on vegetation and on birds and other fauna used as resources by Aboriginal people. This was then compared with palaeo-environmental data to prepare an account of potential resources for the New England region over time. We found that overall productivity of lagoons can be high, with large numbers of plant and animal species present in the wetland environment, especially in the early and very late Holocene. Productivity is highest not at the lake-full stage, but when the moist littoral zones are at their most extensive. The reasons for the apparent sparseness of occupation of the high country before the mid-Holocene are unresolved but open to informed speculation about the changing resource inventory of the wetlands, and the mid-Holocene appearance of new technologies that may have enabled more efficient use of resources. In the later Holocene, Aboriginal occupation in upland areas became visible in the record, and included an exceptionally high number of ceremonial sites juxtaposed with the areas of greatest lagoon concentration. This suggests either that these wetlands had become more productive and diverse over time or that people had learnt how to make better use of the available wetland resources, to the point of supporting the larger numbers often associated with ceremonial activity. More research into the location and chronology of wetland archaeological sites is required to resolve the question of whether the apparent early lack of sites is a question of visibility or a real hiatus.},

Stone toolmaking is a human motor skill which provides the earliest archeological evidence motor skill and social learning. Intentionally shaping a stone into a functional tool relies on the interaction of action observation and practice to support motor skill acquisition. The emergence of adaptive and efficient visuomotor processes during motor learning of such a novel motor skill requiring complex semantic understanding, like stone toolmaking, is not understood. Through the examination of eye movements and motor skill, the current study sought to evaluate the changes and relationship in perceptuomotor processes during motor learning and performance over 90 h of training. Participants' gaze and motor performance were assessed before, during and following training. Gaze patterns reveal a transition from initially high gaze variability during initial observation to lower gaze variability after training. Perceptual changes were strongly associated with motor performance improvements suggesting a coupling of perceptual and motor processes during motor learning.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are gaining considerable interest as a geolocation tool and are now widely applied in archaeology, ecology, and forensic  research. However, their application for provenance requires the development of  baseline models predicting surficial 87Sr/86Sr variations ("isoscapes"). A  variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build  terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not  mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in  geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to  predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based  models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression  framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other  commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the  multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological,  geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides  an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of  environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of  87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and  resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data  available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study  provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for  Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative  estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest.

	abstract = {Sulfur isotope composition of organic tissues is a commonly used tool for gathering information about provenance and diet in archaeology and paleoecology. However, the lack of maps predicting sulfur isotope variations on the landscape limits the possibility to use this isotopic system in quantitative geographic assignments. We compiled a database of 2,680 sulfur isotope analyses in the collagen of archaeological human and animal teeth from 221 individual locations across Western Europe. We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe. The resulting model shows that sulfur isotope patterns are highly predictable, with 65\% of sulfur isotope variations explained using only 4 variables representing marine sulfate deposition and local geological conditions. We used this novel sulfur isoscape and existing strontium and oxygen isoscapes of Western Europe to apply triple isotopes continuous-surface probabilistic geographic assignments to assess the origin of a series of teeth from local animals and humans from Brittany. We accurately and precisely constrained the origin of these individuals to limited regions of Brittany. This approach is broadly transferable to studies in archaeology and paleoecology as illustrated in a companion paper (Colleter et al. 2021).},

Many dental age and gender detection procedures have limitations, such as minimal accuracy and dependability. Gender identification techniques aren't well studied, despite the fact that classification effectiveness and accuracy are low. The suggested approach takes into account the shortcomings of the current system. Deep learning techniques can successfully resolve issues that occurred in other classifiers. Human gender and age identification is a crucial process in the fields of forensics, anthropology, and bio archeology. The image preparation and feature extraction process are accomplished by deep learning algorithms. The performance of classification is improved by minimizing the occurrence of loss with the assistance of a spike neuron-based convolutional neural network (SN-CNN). The performance of SN-CNN is examined by comparing the performance metrics with the existing state-of-art techniques. SN-CNN-based classifier achieved 99.6\% accuracy over existing techniques.},

Acquiring and tagging point clouds is more expensive and tedious labour than its image equivalent process. Point cloud online datasets contain few samples for Deep Learning or not always the desired classes This work focuses on minimizing the use of point cloud samples for neural network training in urban object classification. The method proposed is based on the conversion of point clouds to images (pc-images) because it enables: the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, the generation of several samples (images) per object (point clouds) by means of multi-view, and the combination of pc-images with images from online datasets (ImageNet and Google Images). The study is conducted with ten classes of objects extracted from two street point clouds from two different cities. The network selected for the job is the InceptionV3. The training set consists of 5000 online images with a variable percentage (0\% to 10\%) of pc-images. The validation and testing sets are composed exclusively of pc-images. Although the network trained only with online images reached 47\% accuracy, the inclusion of a small percentage of pc-images in the training set improves the classification to 99.5\% accuracy with 6\% pc-images. The network is also applied at IQmulus \& TerraMobilita Contest dataset and it allows the correct classification of elements with few samples.},

Current research emphases include applications of quantitative modelling and meta-analysis; the correlation of fluvial events to other records, notably palaeolacustine records; and methods for application to diverse issues of river engineering and management. The international expansion and detailed analyses of fluvial palaeohydrology are exemplified by recent studies done in Fennoscandia, the Mediterranean region, India, Israel, Australia, Pacific humid island arcs, and South America. Future developments will involve expanded work with other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, as well as applications to practical problems arising from future climatic change and related environmental hazards, particularly extremes. Remote sensing and high-resolution topography data and tools (e.g. LiDAR) will facilitate new discoveries of ancient exceptional flooding phenomena (megaflooding and superfloods) on Earth and on the palaeofluvial forms of Earth-like planets.

	abstract = {The region of Southern Ethiopia (Borana) and Northern Kenya (Marsabit) is characterised by erratic rainfall, limited surface water, aridity, and frequent droughts. An important adaptive response to these conditions, of uncertain antiquity, has been the hand-excavation of a sequence of deep wells at key locations often along seasonal riverbeds and valley bottoms where subterranean aquifers can be tapped. Sophisticated indigenous water management systems have developed to ensure equitable access to these critical water resources, and these are part of well-defined customary institutional leadership structures that govern the community giving rise to a distinctive form of biocultural heritage. These systems, and the wells themselves, are increasingly under threat, however, from climate change, demographic growth, and socio-economic development. To contribute to an assessment of the scale, distribution and intensity of these threats, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use land-cover (LULC) and precipitation changes in this semi-arid to arid landscape and their association with, and impact on, the preservation of traditional wells. Multitemporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the period 1990 to 2020, analysed at a temporal resolution of 10 years, was classified using supervised classification via the Random Forest machine learning method to extract the following classes: bare land, grassland, shrub land, open forest, closed forest, croplands, settlement and waterbodies. Change detection was then applied to identify and quantify changes through time and landscape degradation indices were generated using the Shannon Diversity Index fragmentation index within a 15 km buffer of each well cluster. The results indicated that land cover change was mostly driven by increasing anthropogenic changes with resultant reduction in natural land cover classes. Furthermore, increased fragmentation has occurred within most of the selected buffer distances of the well clusters. The main drivers of change that have directly or indirectly impacted land degradation and the preservation of indigenous water management systems were identified through an analysis of land cover changes in the last 30 years, supporting insights from previous focused group discussions with communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Our approach showed that remote sensing methods can be used for the spatially explicit mapping of landscape structure around the wells, and ultimately towards assessment of the preservation status of the indigenous wells.},

To address the challenge, we propose to use a transfer learning  approach whereby the model is first trained on a synthetic dataset replicating  features of the original objects. In this study, the objects were smartphone  photographs of near-complete Roman terra sigillata pottery vessels from the  collection of the Museum of London. Taking the replicated features from published  profile drawings of pottery forms allowed the integration of expert knowledge  into the process through our synthetic data generator. After this first initial  training the model was fine-tuned with data from photographs of real vessels. We  show, through exhaustive experiments across several popular deep learning  architectures, different test priors, and considering the impact of the  photograph viewpoint and excessive damage to the vessels, that the proposed  hybrid approach enables the creation of classifiers with appropriate  generalisation performance. This performance is significantly better than that of  classifiers trained exclusively on the original data, which shows the promise of  the approach to alleviate the fundamental issue of learning from small datasets.},

However, over the centuries, many inscriptions  have been damaged to the point of illegibility, transported far from their  original location and their date of writing is steeped in uncertainty. Here we  present Ithaca, a deep neural network for the textual restoration, geographical  attribution and chronological attribution of ancient Greek inscriptions. Ithaca  is designed to assist and expand the historian's workflow. The architecture of  Ithaca focuses on collaboration, decision support and interpretability. While  Ithaca alone achieves 62\% accuracy when restoring damaged texts, the use of  Ithaca by historians improved their accuracy from 25\% to 72\%, confirming the  synergistic effect of this research tool. Ithaca can attribute inscriptions to  their original location with an accuracy of 71\% and can date them to less than  30 years of their ground-truth ranges, redating key texts of Classical Athens and  contributing to topical debates in ancient history. This research shows how  models such as Ithaca can unlock the cooperative potential between artificial  intelligence and historians, transformationally impacting the way that we study  and write about one of the most important periods in human history.},

The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)). Researchers also refer to the potential for archaeologists to explore such artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in various ways, such as identifying archaeological features and classifying them. Here, we present a review study related to the contributions of remote sensing (RS) and artificial intelligence in archaeology. However, a main question remains open in the field of research: the rate of positive contribution of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques in archaeological research. The scope of this study is to summarize the state of the art related to AI and RS for archaeological research and provide some further insights into the existing literature.},

Our research investigates the northernmost 25 km of the Manati Hydrological Basin in Puerto Rico, focusing on evidence of human activity and environmental characteristics including topography, sediments and vegetation cover. The data collected, which articulates archaeological and ethnographic records, covers the span of pre-Columbian occupation of the region, through the colonial periods, and into the twentieth century. Results show that human activity through time has deeply altered the forests. The accumulation of long-term histories of biotic, abiotic and cultural dynamics affects social sensitivity and exposure. Human ingenuity can widen resilience thresholds, making long-term practices particularly important components of adaptive strategies. Deep-time socioecological perspectives can contribute to current vulnerability assessments by enhancing local and historical records that can feed predictive models and inform decision-making in the present.},

Spatial analysis by a taphonomic approach to the distribution of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) provides useful information about intra-site spaces and environments in the Early Neolithic lakeside settlement of La Draga (Banyoles, NE Iberia). The spatial correlation of algae, lakeshore and aquatic plants and herbs with an economic value, together with eggs of intestinal parasites and spores of coprophilous fungi, evidence a humid and organic environment beneath a hut, where consumption waste is concentrated. In contrast, high values of arboreal pollen (AP) and spores of fungal indicators of soil erosion show a sub-aerial environment strongly altered by taphonomic processes in outside areas. Finally, the association of the highest values in Cerealia-t and the spatial distribution of grinding stones within Sector D identifies an area of cereal processing, proving the suitability of spatial analysis in archaeopalynology as a powerful tool for reconstructing activity areas within archaeological settlements.

	abstract = {Multi-scale contextual modelling is an important toolset for environmental mapping. It accounts for spatial dependence by using covariates on multiple  spatial scales and incorporates spatial context and structural dependence to  environmental properties into machine learning models. For spatial soil  modelling, three relevant scales or ranges of scale exist: quasi-local soil  formation processes that are independent of the spatial context, short-range  catenary processes, and long-range processes related to climate and large-scale  terrain settings. Recent studies investigated the spatial dependence of topsoil  properties only. We hypothesize that soil properties within a soil profile were  formed due to specific interactions between different features and scales of the  spatial context, and that there are depth gradients in spatial and structural  dependencies. The results showed that for topsoil, features at small to  intermediate scales do not increase model accuracy, whereas large scales increase  model accuracy. In contrast, subsoil models benefit from all scales-small,  intermediate, and large. Based on the differences in relevance, we conclude that  the relevant ranges of scales do not only differ in the horizontal domain, but  also in the vertical domain across the soil profile. This clearly demonstrates  the impact of contextual spatial modelling on 3D soil mapping.},

The aims of the study  were: first, to establish the existence of alterations in the King's written  language at the onset of his first manic episode; and secondly to identify  salient sources of variation contributing to the changes. Effects on language  were sought in two control conditions (politically stressful vs. politically  tranquil periods and seasonal variation). We found clear differences in the  letter corpus, across a range of different features, in association with the  onset of mental derangement, which were driven by a combination of linguistic and  information theory features that appeared to be specific to the contrast between  acute mania and mental stability. The paucity of existing data relevant to  changes in written language in the presence of acute mania suggests that lexical,  syntactic and stylometric descriptions of written discourse produced by a cohort  of patients with a diagnosis of acute mania will be necessary to support the  diagnosis independently and to look for other periods of mental illness of the  course of the King's life, and in other historically significant figures with  similarly large archives of handwritten documents.},

Understanding the firing regimes of archaeological ceramics reveals clues about the history of technological developments, but current methods for determining firing history have limitations. We experimented with non-destructive micro-CT combined with 3D image analysis to collect data on 42 pore variables, hypothesizing that pore systems are affected by ceramic firing temperatures. Analysis of variance showed that 26 of the variables are significantly related to firing temperature. Total volume porosity (open and closed pores) goes down with increased firing temperature, as does the fraction of pores accessible to a surface. Maximum pore volume, maximum and standard deviation of pore surface area, and pore elongation measures all decrease with higher firing temperatures while shape factors indicating greater sphericity increase. Pore connectivity measures decrease with higher firing temperatures, and variation in pore and connection lengths increases. The highest fired ceramics have low connection tortuosity. Three-dimensional image analysis of micro-CT data can augment existing methods of archaeothermometry, and since many pore characteristics impact the functional properties of ceramics (density, durability, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, permeability, and diffusion), firing temperature studies of pore systems can inform wider archaeological ceramics research.},

Menez-Dregan I (Brittany, France) is one of the key sites in  Western Europe that dates from this threshold, with an alternating sequence of 16  occupation levels and four marine deposits, from MIS 12 to 8. The large lithic  assemblages of more than 154,000 artifacts from knapping (cores, flakes) and  shaping (macrotools and shaping flakes) show the varying use of raw materials and  activities at the site through the sequence. This work focuses on the study of  the handaxes and cleavers using technological and metrical methods with  multivariate analysis, in combination with geometric morphometrics, and places  these analyses within the context of other technological changes at the site.  Collectively, results show the persistent use through the sequence of the same  lithic raw materials and technologies, including fire use and the import of  glossy sandstone from 20 km away, but with variation in activities at the site.  These findings suggest that Menez-Dregan I shows the development of a specific  material culture that reflects the local resources and environment. Results  further indicate that the site shows the sustained hominin occupation of the  area, despite varying climate and environment, with strong traditions of social  learning that were maintained through flexibility of site use, deep understanding  of the local territory, and the innovation of new technologies, such as the use  of fire. Evidence from the site is placed within the wider context of Europe, and  contrasted with areas to the north, such as Britain, where hominin occupation was  more sporadic and driven by cyclical climate change.},

So this problem is divided into two major tasks the first of which is the Classification of Archaeological Fragments into similar groups (CAF) and the second one is the Reconstruction of each group into the original Archaeological Objects (RAO). To solve this problem, a method has been proposed, which exploits the color and texture properties of the surfaces of the fragments. Furthermore, the reconstruction of archaeological fragments in 3D geometry is an important problem in pattern recognition. Therefore, this research has implemented the algorithms to reconstruct real datasets using Neural Networks. The challenge of this work is to reconstruct the objects without previous knowledge about the part that should start the assembly; this greatly helps to avoid the presence of gaps created due to missing artifact fragments. The study utilizes the geometric features of the fragments as important features to reconstruct the objects by classifying their fragments using a Neural Network model. (C) 2018 The Authors.

In this paper, the ability and capacity of deep CNNs in automatic classification of two handwriting based demographical problems, i.e. gender and handedness classification, have been examined by using advanced CNNs; DenseNet201, InceptionV3, and Xception. Two databases, IAM (English texts) and KHATT (Arabic texts) have been employed in this study. The achieved results showed that the proposed CNNs architectures performed well in improving classification results, with 84\% accuracy (1.27\% improvement) for gender classification using the IAM database, and 99.14\% accuracy (28.23\% improvement) for handedness classification using the KHATT database.},

Here, we present an innovative method for identifying community structures in the archaeological record that allows for independent evaluation of the copper using societies in the Balkans, from c. 6200 to c. 3200 BC. We achieve this by exploring modularity of networked systems of these societies across an estimated 3000 years. We employ chemical data of copper-based objects from 79 archaeological sites as the independent variable for detecting most densely interconnected sets of nodes with a modularity maximization method [4]. Our results reveal three dominant modular structures across the entire period, which exhibit strong spatial and temporal significance. We interpret patterns of copper supply among prehistoric societies as reflective of social relations, which emerge as equally important as physical proximity. Although designed on a variable isolated from any archaeological and spatiotemporal information, our method provides archaeologically and spatiotemporally meaningful results. It produces models of human interaction and cooperation that can be evaluated independently of established archaeological systematics, and can find wide application on any quantitative data from archaeological and historical record.},

However, it remains unclear to what extent different burial  environments impact these aspects of proteome decay. Teeth have to date been much  less studied than bone but are ideal to explore how proteins decay with time due  to the negligible turnover that occurs in dentine relative to bone. We  investigated the proteome variability and deamidation levels of different  sections of molar teeth from archeological bovine mandibles as well as their  mandibular bone. We obtained a greater yield of proteins from the crown of the  teeth but did not find differences between the different molars analyzed within  each mandible. We also obtained the best variety of protein from a well-preserved  mandible that was not the youngest one in terms of chronological age, showing the  influence of the preservation conditions on the final proteomic outcome.  Intriguingly, we also noticed an increase in abundance levels of fetuin-A in  biologically younger mandibles as reported previously, but the opposite trend in  tooth dentine. Interestingly, we observed higher glutamine deamidation levels in  teeth from the geologically oldest mandible despite it being the biologically  youngest specimen, showing that the archeological age strongly impacts on the  level of deamidations observed, much more so than biological aging. This  indicates that the glutamine deamidation ratio of selected peptides may act as a  good predictor of the relative geochronological age of archeological specimens.},

To date, there are few solutions thoroughly tested in the field designed to perform this specific task, none of which operate autonomously. With a small, low-cost biomimetic platform known as the U-CAT, we developed a mapping-mission software architecture in which the vehicle executes three key sensor-based reactive stages: entering, exploring, and exiting. Encapsulated in the exploring stage are several state-defined navigation strategies, called patterns, which were designed and initially tested in simulation. The results of simulation work informed the selection of two patterns that were executed in field trials at a submerged building in Rummu Quarry Lake, Estonia, as part of several full mapping missions. Over the course of these trials, the vehicle was capable of observing the majority (78-97\%) of 49.9 explorable square meters within 7 minutes. Based on these results, we demonstrate the capability of a low-cost and resource-constrained vehicle to perform confined space mapping under sensor uncertainty. Further, the observations made by the vehicle are shown to be suitable for a target site reconstruction and analysis in post-processing, which is the intended outcome of this type of mission in practical applications.},

	abstract = {In the domain of computer vision, object recognition aims at detecting and classifying objects in data sets. Model-driven approaches are typically constrained through their focus on either a specific type of data, a context (indoor, outdoor) or a set of objects. Machine learning-based approaches are more flexible but also constrained as they need annotated data sets to train the learning process. That leads to problems when this data is not available through the specialty of the application field, like archaeology, for example. In order to overcome such constraints, we present a fully semantic-guided approach. The role of semantics is to express all relevant knowledge of the representation of the objects inside the data sets and of the algorithms which address this representation. In addition, the approach contains a learning stage since it adapts the processing according to the diversity of the objects and data characteristics. The semantic is expressed via an ontological model and uses standard web technology like SPARQL queries, providing great flexibility. The ontological model describes the object, the data and the algorithms. It allows the selection and execution of algorithms adapted to the data and objects dynamically. Similarly, processing results are dynamically classified and allow for enriching the ontological model using SPARQL construct queries. The semantic formulated through SPARQL also acts as a bridge between the knowledge contained within the ontological model and the processing branch, which executes algorithms. It provides the capability to adapt the sequence of algorithms to an individual state of the processing chain and makes the solution robust and flexible. The comparison of this approach with others on the same use case shows the efficiency and improvement this approach brings.},

We show how the results support different diagenetic conditions for both penecontemporaneous sites, which are appropriate for their respective locations on the palaeolandscape to which they belonged. We also show how geochemical analyses of the clay deposit that embedded both sites indicate a similar soil pH divergence. PTK was formed on an alluvial sloping surface affected by rills but draining efficiently, which resulted in alkaline soil conditions, that optimised bone-surface preservation. DS occurred in a more depressed area that underwent intermittent flooding, affecting soil chemistry by creating more acidic conditions. This impacted on bone surfaces by dynamically modifying mark morphology. This deep-learning approach has relevance for the interpretation of the local palaeoecological conditions of both assemblages and their respective depositional loci. The results presented here open a new window to the incremental information gain through the use of artificial intelligence methods in taphonomic and palaeoecological research.},

While efforts have been made to independently validate these projections against the archaeological record and contemporary measures of genetic diversity, there has been no comprehensive assessment of how parameter values and choice of palaeoclimate model affect projections of early human migration. We simulated human migration into North America with a process-explicit migration model using simulated palaeoclimate data from two different atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and did a sensitivity analysis on the outputs using a machine learning algorithm. We found that simulated human migration into North America was more sensitive to un-certainty in demographic parameters than choice of atmosphere-ocean general circulation model used for simulating climate-human interactions. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of process-explicit human migration models will be improved with further research on the population dynamics of ancient humans, and that uncertainties in model parameters must be considered in estimates of the timing and rate of human colo-nisation and their consequence on biodiversity.},

This article ponders this question by drawing on archaeological encounters with assemblages of drift matter (seaborne debris) in Norway and Iceland. Here, drift matter manifests evidence of both the relentlessly amassing material heritage of the Anthropocene and deep legacies of local engagement with this fluctuating resource. The tensions evoked along these coastlines therefore invite explorations of some of the challenges met in the current climate, problematizing conceptions of heritage and waste, wanteds and unwanteds, salvation and loss. Surely, drift matter is today largely perceived as not belonging in these natural environs. However, are there other thing lessons to be learned from taking seriously this heritage? Avoiding an interpretation of these things as out of context and a focus merely on what has been lost, this article asks whether it is possible that the sense of ambiguity, flux and drift emitted by this material may not only challenge but also enable alternative possibilities of knowing things - alternatives that may be of significance for a heritage in and of the Anthropocene.},

We sought to isolate the biophysical predictors that explain forest loss in the pre-historic (i.e. pre-European) period in New Zealand. Location New Zealand. Methods We used resampled boosted regression trees to isolate the key predictors of forest loss from a suite of 19 topographic, climatic, soil-related and archaeological predictors at a 1-km spatial resolution across New Zealand. Results The key predictors of fire-driven forest loss during New Zealand's pre-history relate to moisture and elevation gradients, with sites characterized by low moisture levels and gentle slopes being most vulnerable. Proxies for human activity were important in the North Island, where Maori population densities were higher, but not the South Island. The predicted pattern of forest loss and its relationship with biophysical variables suggest that early Maori neither deliberately protected fire-prone regions nor systematically burnt less fire-prone ones. Main conclusions Before Maori settlement of New Zealand fire was naturally rare, despite biophysical conditions being conducive to fire spread. The introduction of an ignition source by humans made widespread forest loss inevitable, even in the absence of sustained and deliberate use of fire. Rapid forest loss at the time of human settlement is recurrent across eastern Polynesia, so understanding this dynamic in New Zealand has implications for the region as a whole.},

A growing number of strategies for the three-dimensional (3D) acquisition and modelling of these invaluable assets have been developed in the last few years. Their objective is to efficiently respond to this documentation need and contribute to deepening the knowledge of the masterpieces investigated constantly by researchers operating in many fieldworks. Nowadays, one of the most effective solutions is represented by the development of image-based techniques, usually connected to a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach. However, while images acquisition is relatively rapid, the processes connected to data processing are very time-consuming and require the operator’s substantial manual involvement. Developing deep learning-based strategies can be an effective solution to enhance the automatism level. In this research, which has been carried out in the framework of the digitisation of a wooden maquettes collection stored in the ‘Museo Egizio di Torino’, using a photogrammetric approach, an automatic masking strategy using deep learning techniques is proposed, to increase the level of automatism and therefore, optimise the photogrammetric pipeline. Starting from a manually annotated dataset, a neural network was trained to automatically perform a semantic classification to isolate the maquettes from the background. The proposed methodology allowed the researchers to obtain automatically segmented masks with a high degree of accuracy. The workflow is described (as regards acquisition strategies, dataset processing, and neural network training). In addition, the accuracy of the results is evaluated and discussed. Finally, the researchers proposed the possibility of performing a multiclass segmentation on the digital images to recognise different object categories in the images, as well as to define a semantic hierarchy to perform automatic classification of different elements in the acquired images.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Highlights:{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}ul{\textgreater}{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the framework of movable heritage digitisation processes, many procedures are very time-consuming, and they still require the operator’s substantial manual involvement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/li{\textgreater}{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This research proposes using deep learning techniques to enhance the automatism level in the generation of exclusion masks, improving the optimisation of the photogrammetric procedures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/li{\textgreater}{\textless}li{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Following this strategy, the possibility of performing a multiclass semantic segmentation (on the 2D images and, consequently, on the 3D point cloud) is also discussed, considering the accuracy of the obtainable results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/li{\textgreater}{\textless}/ul{\textgreater}},

This  paper explores the use of Bayesian networks as explanatory models of the  independent variables-the environment- and dependent variables-social decisions-,  and also as predictive models. The study highlights how subsistence strategies  are modified by ecological and topographical variables of the settlement location  and their relationship with social organisation. It also establishes the role of  Bayesian networks as a suitable supervised Machine Learning methodology for  investigating socio-ecological systems, introducing their use to build useful  data-driven models to address relevant archaeological and anthropological  questions.},

Using published and new isotope data from across western Europe, the author examines changing resource use from c. ad 350 to 1200. The geographical limits of millet and substantial marine consumption are identified and comparisons between childhood and adult diets made across regions. Cross-cultural interaction at a broad scale is emphasized and patterns within early medieval England form the subject of an in-depth case study. While doubt is cast onto the uptake of marine resource consumption in England following the Fish Event Horizon, changes in agricultural practices, the impact of Christianization, and the role of freshwater fish in diets are explored. The author's hierarchical meta-analytical approach enables identification of human-environment interactions, with significant implications for changing foodways in Europe during the first millennium ad.},

While initial attempts to  characterise the major categories used in osseous industry (i.e. bone, antler,  and dentine/ivory) have been successful, the taxonomic determination of  prehistoric artefacts remains to be investigated. The distinction between  reindeer and red deer antler can be challenging, particularly in cases of  anthropic and/or taphonomic modifications. In addition to the range of  destructive physicochemical identification methods available (mass spectrometry,  isotopic ratio, and DNA analysis), X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) provides  convincing non-destructive 3D images and analyses. This paper presents the  experimental protocol (sample scans, image processing, and statistical analysis)  we have developed in order to identify modern and archaeological antler  collections (from Isturitz, France). This original method is based on bone  microstructure analysis combined with advanced statistical support vector machine  (SVM) classifiers. A combination of six microarchitecture biomarkers (bone volume  fraction, trabecular number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness,  trabecular bone pattern factor, and structure model index) were screened using  micro-CT in order to characterise internal alveolar structure. Overall, reindeer  alveoli presented a tighter mesh than red deer alveoli, and statistical analysis  allowed us to distinguish archaeological antler by species with an accuracy of  96\%, regardless of anatomical location on the antler. In conclusion, micro-CT  combined with SVM classifiers proves to be a promising additional non-destructive  method for antler identification, suitable for archaeological artefacts whose  degree of human modification and cultural heritage or scientific value has  previously made it impossible (tools, ornaments, etc.).},

Nevertheless, various attempts have been made to find a more scientifically valid way into our deep human past of storytelling. Following the social brain hypothesis, we suggest including into the theory of human storytelling more fine-grained and evidence-based findings (from archaeology, the cognitive sciences, and evolutionary psychology) about the manifold exaptation and adaptation, genetic changes, and phenotypic plasticity in the deep human past, which all shaped the emergence of storytelling in hominins. We identify three preconditions for humans sharing stories: first, the long evolution of language in the different taxa as one of the preconditions of ostensive signaling; second, the pivotal role of childhood in the evolution of collaborative intentionality; and third, the role of fireside chats in the rise of elaborative (i.e., narrative) sharing of stories. We propose that humans, albeit perhaps no other hominins learned to understand others through sharing stories, not only as intentional agents, but also as mental ones.},

Constructing fully connected networks using low power consumption sensors, devices, and protocols is one of the main challenges facing wireless sensor networks, especially in places where it is difficult to establish wireless networks in a normal way, such as military areas, archaeological sites, agricultural districts, construction sites, and so on. This paper proposes an approach for constructing and extending Bi-Directional mesh networks using low power consumption technologies inside various indoors and outdoors architectures called "an adaptable Spider-Mesh topology". The use of ESP-NOW protocol as a communication technology added an advantage of longer communication distance versus a slight increase of consumed power. It provides 15 times longer distance compared to BLE protocol while consuming only twice as much power. Therefore, according to our theoretical and experimental comparisons, the proposed approach could provide higher network coverage while maintaining an acceptable level of power consumption.},

The absence of natural light complicates energy budget considerations for deep diving flash-equipped drones. Refraction effects influence geometric image formation considerations with respect to field of view and focus, while attenuation and scattering degrade the radiometric image quality and limit the effective visibility. As an improvement on the stated issues, we present an AUV-based optical system intended for autonomous visual mapping of large areas of the seafloor (square kilometers) in up to 6000 m water depth. We compare it to existing systems and discuss tradeoffs such as resolution vs. mapped area and show results from a recent deployment with 90,000 mapped square meters of deep ocean floor.},

METHODS:  Haplogroup U5 mitogenome sequences were gathered from GenBank. The hierarchal  Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (hierBAPS) method was used to generate  groups of sequences that were then projected onto a rooted maximum likelihood  (ML) phylogenetic tree to visualize the pattern of clustering. The haplogroup  statuses of the individual sequences were assessed using Haplogrep2. RESULTS: A  total of 23 hierBAPS groups were identified, all of which corresponded to  subclades defined in Phylotree, v.17. The hierBAPS groups projected onto the ML  phylogeny accurately clustered all haplotypes belonging to a specific haplogroup  in accordance with Haplogrep2. By incorporating the geographic source of each  sequence and subclade age estimates into this framework, inferences about the  diversification of U5 mtDNAs were made. Haplogroup U5 has been present in  northern Europe since the Mesolithic, and spread in both eastern and western  directions, undergoing significant diversification within Scandinavia. A review  of historical and archeological evidence attests to some of the population  interactions contributing to this pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The hierBAPS algorithm  accurately grouped mitogenome sequences into subclades in a phylogenetically  robust manner. This analysis provided new insights into the phylogeographic  structure of haplogroup U5 diversity in northern Europe, revealing a detailed  perspective on the diversity of subclades in this region and their distribution  in Scandinavian populations.},

These methods were designed for populations that lived mostly  in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Their level of reliability or  misclassification is important for practical use in today's forensic practice; it  is, however, unknown. We addressed the question of what the likelihood of errors  would be if population specificity of discriminant functions of the tibia were  disregarded. Moreover, five classification functions in a Czech sample were  proposed (accuracies 82.1-87.5 \%, sex bias ranged from -1.3 to -5.4 \%). We  measured ten variables traditionally used for sex assessment of the tibia on a  sample of 30 male and 26 female models from recent Czech population. To estimate  the classification accuracy and error (misclassification) rates ignoring  population specificity, we selected published classification functions of tibia  for the Portuguese, south European, and the North American populations. These  functions were applied on the dimensions of the Czech population. Comparing the  classification success of the reference and the tested Czech sample showed that  females from Czech population were significantly overestimated and mostly  misclassified as males. Overall accuracy of sex assessment significantly  decreased (53.6-69.7 \%), sex bias -29.4-100 \%, which is most probably caused by  secular trend and the generally high variability of body size. Results indicate  that the discriminant functions, developed for skeletal series representing  geographically and chronologically diverse populations, are not applicable in  current forensic investigations. Finally, implications and recommendations for  future research are discussed.},

As part of recent archaeological excavations aimed at understanding the site's transregional trade networks, geoarchaeological analyses were undertaken to document the geomorphic context of the ancient settlement. Here, we outline the results of these field and laboratory studies to discuss patterns of anthropogenic sediment deposition. Unguja Ukuu's deep coastal stratigraphy appears to record progradation of an inhabited back-reef shore from the mid-seventh to the nineth centuries AD, perhaps in the wake of an earlier middle to late Holocene marine transgression. Excavations on the back-beach show that deposits associated with the ancient settlement include interlayered middens, paleofloors, and backshore sands and, in later phases, a peri-urban dump with dark-earth-type anthrosols developed on these deposits. Coastal progradation appears to have been driven in part by the accumulation of anthropogenic detritus and compaction of ancient surfaces. We hypothesize how the inherited, submerged relic Late Pleistocene geomorphology of the intertidal zone and later Holocene sediment supply from the hinterland may have supported the emergence of Unguja Ukuu as a trading locale, and possibly contributed to its decline in the early second millennium AD.},

	abstract = {Automatic remote reflectance spectral imaging of large painted areas in high resolution, from distances of tens of meters, has made the imaging of entire architectural interior feasible. However, it has significantly increased the volume of data. Here we present a machine learning based method to automatically detect 'hidden' writings and map material variations. Clustering of reflectance spectra allowed materials at inaccessible heights to be properly identified by performing non-invasive analysis on regions in the same cluster at accessible heights using a range of complementary spectroscopic techniques. The world heritage site of the Mogao caves, along the ancient Silk Road, consists of 492 richly painted Buddhist cave temples dating from the fourth to fourteenth century. Cave 465 at the northern end of the site is unique in its Indo-Tibetan tantric Buddhist style, and like many other caves, the date of its construction is still under debate. This study demonstrates the powers of an interdisciplinary approach that combines material identification, palaeographic analysis of the revealed Sanskrit writings and archaeological evidence for the dating of the cave temple paintings, narrowing it down to the late twelfth century to thirteenth century.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists often need to date and group artifact types to discern typologies, chronologies, and classifications. For over a century, statisticians have been using classification and clustering techniques to infer patterns in data that can be defined by algorithms. In the case of archaeology, linear regression algorithms are often used to chronologically date features and sites, and pattern recognition is used to develop typologies and classifications. However, archaeological data is often expensive to collect, and analyses are often limited by poor sample sizes and datasets. Here we show that recent advances in computation allow archaeologists to use machine learning based on much of the same statistical theory to address more complex problems using increased computing power and larger and incomplete datasets. This paper approaches the problem of predicting the chronology of archaeological sites through a case study of medieval temples in Angkor, Cambodia. For this study, we have a large dataset of temples with known architectural elements and artifacts; however, less than ten percent of the sample of temples have known dates, and much of the attribute data is incomplete. Our results suggest that the algorithms can predict dates for temples from 821-1150 CE with a 49-66-year average absolute error. We find that this method surpasses traditional supervised and unsupervised statistical approaches for under-specified portions of the dataset and is a promising new method for anthropological inquiry.},

CE. Sex determination and age-at-death estimation were performed using classical macromorphological methods. In certain cases, radiographic imaging, 3D scanning, and radiocarbon dating were also performed. Our cases fit the formerly established understanding of trepanations, with a male majority and signs of trauma as accompanying symptoms. The cause of intervention was mostly therapeutic, i.e., trauma, in most cases. In order to simplify the currently confusing nomenclature in trepanation categories (complete-incomplete vs. surgical-symbolic), we propose the use of "trepanation" exclusively to all forms of intentional, non-violent removals of all three layers of the cranial vault. On the other hand, the phenomena widely known in Eastern Europe as symbolic trepanations should be designated as "cranioglyphs," referring to all forms of superficial interventions administered to the cranial vault that do not penetrate all three layers of the bone. In case the data are insufficient to properly categorize the phenomenon at hand, one should refrain from it, and simply describe the lesion as intentional cranial intervention. In order to bring spotlight to the wide range of cranial interventions in the early medieval Carpathian Basin, our team is conducting several research projects, in order to contribute to a better understanding of these traditions in the future.},

	abstract = {Constant detection and monitoring of archaeological sites and objects have always been an important national goal for many countries. The early identification of changes is crucial to preventive conservation. Archaeologists have always considered using service drones to automate collecting data on and below the ground surface of archaeological sites, with cost and technical barriers being the main hurdles against the wide-scale deployment. Advances in thermal imaging, depth imaging, drones, and artificial intelligence have driven the cost down and improved the quality and volume of data collected and processed. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for archaeological sites detection and monitoring using autonomous service drones. We mount RGB, depth, and thermal cameras on an autonomous drone for low-altitude data acquisition. To align and aggregate collected images, we propose two-stage multimodal depth-to-RGB and thermal-to-RGB mosaicking algorithms. We then apply detection algorithms to the stitched images to identify change regions and design a user interface to monitor these regions over time. Our results show we can create overlays of aligned thermal and depth data on RGB mosaics of archaeological sites. We tested our change detection algorithm and found it has a root mean square error of 0.04. To validate the proposed framework, we tested our thermal image stitching pipeline against state-of-the-art commercial software. We cost-effectively replicated its functionality while adding a new depth-based modality and created a user interface for temporally monitoring changes in multimodal views of archaeological sites.},

However, due to the costs and efforts required for ancient biomolecular analysis, there has been considerable research into development of accurate and efficient screening approaches for archaeological remains. FTIR spectroscopy is one such approach that has been considered for screening of proteins, but its widespread use has been hindered by the fact that its predictive accuracy can vary widely depending on the extent of sample preservation and the instrument used. Further, screening methods for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis are scarce. Here we present a new approach to vastly improve upon FTIR-based screening methods prior to ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) and aDNA analysis through the use of random forest-based machine learning. To do so, we use ATR-FTIR to examine three sets of archaeological bone assemblages and analyse them by ZooMS (for taxonomic identification). Two of these are from Palaeolithic contexts, dominated by terrestrial fauna and include specimens with a variety of preservational conditions. The third set consists of Holocene faunal remains, with variable levels of preservation and is dominated by cetaceans. Using the Holocene faunal remains, we were able to more consistently evaluate ATR-FTIR-based screening for mtDNA as well as ZooMS success. We report on the potential of machine learning in ATR-FTIR-based screening for ancient mtDNA analysis, and our machine learning models conclusively improve the accuracy prior to usage of ATR-FTIR-based screening for ZooMS by 20?40\%. The results also suggest this approach potentially allows for a universal screening system, applicable across multiple sites and largely independent of the spectrometers used.},

For example, a forensic pathologist may benefit from  deep learning-based tools in gunshot wound interpretation. This proof-of-concept  study aimed to test the hypothesis that trained neural network architectures have  potential to predict shooting distance class on the basis of a simple photograph  of the gunshot wound. A dataset of 204 gunshot wound images (60 negative  controls, 50 contact shots, 49 close-range shots, and 45 distant shots) was  constructed on the basis of nineteen piglet carcasses fired with a .22 Long Rifle  pistol. The dataset was used to train, validate, and test the ability of neural  net architectures to correctly classify images on the basis of shooting distance.  Deep learning was performed using the AIDeveloper open-source software. Of the  explored neural network architectures, a trained multilayer perceptron based  model (MLP\_24\_16\_24) reached the highest testing accuracy of 98\%. Of the testing  set, the trained model was able to correctly classify all negative controls,  contact shots, and close-range shots, whereas one distant shot was misclassified.  Our study clearly demonstrated that in the future, forensic pathologists may  benefit from deep learning-based tools in gunshot wound interpretation. With  these data, we seek to provide an initial impetus for larger-scale research on  deep learning approaches in forensic wound interpretation.},

	abstract = {Aerial imagery captured via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is playing an increasingly important role in disaster response. Unlike satellite imagery,  aerial imagery can be captured and processed within hours rather than days. In  addition, the spatial resolution of aerial imagery is an order of magnitude  higher than the imagery produced by the most sophisticated commercial satellites  today. Both the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the  European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) have noted that aerial imagery  will inevitably present a big data challenge. The purpose of this article is to  get ahead of this future challenge by proposing a hybrid crowdsourcing and  real-time machine learning solution to rapidly process large volumes of aerial  data for disaster response in a time-sensitive manner. Crowdsourcing can be used  to annotate features of interest in aerial images (such as damaged shelters and  roads blocked by debris). These human-annotated features can then be used to  train a supervised machine learning system to learn to recognize such features in  new unseen images. In this article, we describe how this hybrid solution for  image analysis can be implemented as a module (i.e., Aerial Clicker) to extend an  existing platform called Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (AIDR),  which has already been deployed to classify microblog messages during disasters  using its Text Clicker module and in response to Cyclone Pam, a category 5  cyclone that devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. The hybrid solution we present can  be applied to both aerial and satellite imagery and has applications beyond  disaster response such as wildlife protection, human rights, and archeological  exploration. As a proof of concept, we recently piloted this solution using very  high-resolution aerial photographs of a wildlife reserve in Namibia to support  rangers with their wildlife conservation efforts (SAVMAP project,  http://lasig.epfl.ch/savmap ). The results suggest that the platform we have  developed to combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to make sense of large  volumes of aerial images can be used for disaster response.},

A simple algorithm  that combines two discriminant functions is also proposed. It was found that the  differences in the classification performance between BLR, PR, CPR, LDA, QDA,  ANN, and NBC are overall small. However, LDA is simpler and more flexible than  CPR, QDA, and ANN and has a small but clear advantage over BLR, NBC, and PR.  Consequently, LDA may be preferred in skeletal sex estimation. Finally, it is  striking that the combination of pelvic and cranial traits via their discriminant  functions, determined either by BLR or LDA, removes practically any  population-specificity and yields much better predictions than the individual  functions; in fact, the prediction accuracy increases above 97\%.},

Geostatistics allows producing these maps from a sample of locations by modelling the spatial autocorrelation structure of these kind of phenomena. However, the homogeneity of the prediction regions is a strong assumption in the model. The presence of barriers, such as the inner walls of domestic units, introduces discontinuities in prediction areas. In this paper, we investigate how to incorporate information of a geographical nature into the process of geostatistical prediction. We propose the use of cost-based distances to quantify the correlation between locations, a solution which has proved to be a practical alternative approach for archaeological intrasite analysis. The cost-based approach produces more reliable results avoiding the unrealistic assumption of the homogeneity of the study area. As a working example, a case study of the distribution of two specific chemical signatures in domestic floors is presented within a controlled ethnographical context in Northern Gujarat (India). On a broad disciplinary scale, the benefits of using our approach include improved estimates in regions with complex geometry and lower uncertainty in the kriging predictions. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The decrease in  bone mineral density with age was explored to generate a method to assess age at  death in human remains. A connectionist computational approach, artificial neural  networks, was employed to model femur densitometry data gathered in 100 female  individuals from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection. Bone mineral density  declines consistently with age and the method performs appropriately, with mean  absolute differences between known and predicted age ranging from 9.19 to 13.49  years.

	abstract = {In Cultural Heritage inquiries, a common requirement is to establish time-based trends between archaeological artifacts belonging to different periods of a given culture, enabling among other things to determine chronological inferences with higher accuracy and precision. Among these, pottery vessels are significantly useful, given their relative abundance in most archaeological sites. However, this very abundance makes difficult and complex an accurate representation, since no two of these vessels are identical, and therefore classification criteria must be justified and applied. For this purpose, we propose the use of deep learning architectures to extract automatically learned features without prior knowledge or engineered features. By means of transfer learning, we retrained a Residual Neural Network with a binary image database of Iberian wheel-made pottery vessels' profiles. These vessels pertain to archaeological sites located in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). The resulting model can provide an accurate feature representation space, which can automatically classify profile images, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.96 with an f -measure of 0.96. This accuracy is remarkably higher than other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, where several feature extraction techniques were applied together with multiple classifier models. These results provide novel strategies to current research in automatic feature representation and classification of different objects of study within the Archaeology domain.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine if visible reflectance spectroscopy and quantitative colorimetry represent viable approaches to classifying the heat  treatment state of silcrete. Silcrete is a soil duricrust that has been used as  toolstone since at least the Middle Stone Age. The ancient practice of heat  treating silcrete prior to knapping is of considerable interest to paleolithic  archaeologists because of its implications for early modern human complex  cognition generally and the ability to manipulate the material properties of  stone specifically. Here, we demonstrate that our quantitative, non-invasive, and  portable approach to measuring color, used in conjunction with k-Nearest  Neighbors "lazy" machine learning, is a highly promising method for heat  treatment detection. Traditional, expert human analyst approaches typically rely  upon subjective assessments of color and luster and comparison to experimental  reference collections. This strongly visual method can prove quite accurate, but  difficult to reproduce between different analysts. In this work, we measured  percent reflectance for the visible spectrum (1018 variables) and standardized  color values (CIEL*a*b*) in unheated and experimentally heat-treated silcrete  specimens from three sources in South Africa. k-NN classification proved highly  effective with both the spectroscopy and colorimetry data sets. An important  innovation was using the heat treatment state predicted by the k-NN model for the  majority of replicate observations of a single specimen to predict the heat  treatment state for the specimen overall. When this majority voting approach was  applied to the 746 individual observations in this study, associated with 94  discrete silcrete flakes, both spectroscopy and colorimetry k-NN models yielded  0\% test set misclassification rates at the specimen level.},

	abstract = {The present study proposes a workflow to extract from orthomosaics the enormous amount of dry stones used by past societies to construct funeral complexes in the Mongolian steppes. Several different machine learning algorithms for binary pixel classification (i.e. stone vs non-stone) were evaluated. Input features were extracted from high-resolution orthomosaics and digital elevation models (both derived from aerial imaging). Comparative analysis used two colour spaces (RGB and HSV), texture features (contrast, homogeneity and entropy raster maps), and the topographic position index, combined with nine supervised learning algorithms (nearest centroid, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network). When features are processed together, excellent output maps, very close to or outperforming current standards in archaeology, are observed for almost all classifiers. The size of the training set can be drastically reduced (to ca. 300 samples) by majority voting, while maintaining performance at the highest level (about 99.5\% for all performance scores). Note, however, that if the training set is inadequate or not fully representative, the classification results are poor. That said, the methods applied and tested here are extremely rapid. Extensive mapping, which would have been difficult with traditional, manual, or semiautomatic delineation of stones using a vector graphics editor, now becomes possible.

We tested the methodology on a set of rock art painting images captured with a number of digital cameras. The characterization approach based on the P-ASK framework allows the reduction of the training sample size and a better color adjustment to the chromatic range of the input scene. In addition, the computing time required for model training is less than in the regular approach with all color chips, and obtained average color differences Delta E-ab(*) lower than two CIELAB units. Furthermore, the graphic and numeric results obtained for the characterized images are encouraging and confirms that the P-ASK framework based on the K-means algorithm is suitable for automatic patch selection for camera characterization purposes.},

For this purpose, an Intelligent Instructional System (ITS) is defined using the concepts: inputs, outputs, perturbations factors, regulation, feedback and AI learning techniques. The contextual environment of learning plays the major role in this system and it establishes the perturbation factors. The regulation consists in AI learning techniques, so the ITS is a flexible and adaptive system. The process' behaviour is described using pseudo-boolean and linear equations. This kind of approach enables solving the problems of the complexity and uncertainty of the learning (instructional) systems and, particularly, those of the e-learning (online and offline).

Analysts, thus, lose the opportunity to resolve an important part of the equifinality related to activities that hominins and different types of carnivores may produce. Recent studies have shown that the use of powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms allow the accurate classification of bone surface modifications (BSM). Here, we present an experimental study, applying these algorithms to the analysis of bone breakage patterns. This statistical methodology allows the correct classification of three different assemblages which have been generated anthropogenically and by the activity of carnivores (i.e., hyenas and wolves). ML algorithms applied to a multivariate set of properties of broken bone specimens yielded an accuracy of 95\% and were higher in classifying agency without the need to include information from BSM. This paper proposes a methodological approach that opens the door to improve our understanding of referential frameworks regarding bone breakage and to determine agency in prehistoric bone breakage processes.},

We focused onto the Munsell color space as archaeologists are used to employ the so called Munsell Soil Color Charts (MSCCs) directly in the excavation sites. For these scholars and researchers, being enabled to perform Munsell color specification in an automatic way is crucial, as they spend a lot of time to subjectively specify colors in the Munsell system. We extended the dataset ARCA328, which was specifically thought for the automatic Munsell color specification issue, increasing the number of images from 328 to 1,488, and the number of samples from 56,160 to 315,333. Then, we conducted generalization-tests of color conversion for color specification, adopting a classification approach instead of a regression one. This choice was motivated by the fact that the set of all the possible HVC coordinates in the MSCCs is a discrete one. Hence, we decided to consider each chip in the MSCCs as a class to be learnt and recognized by the SVC. With these tests we highligthed the limits of automatic Munsell color specification without any reference-system or calibration phase. Finally, we gave insights for future works aimed to design automatic illuminant calibration phase and to investigate deep learning approaches, leveraging a synthetic images rendering procedure we also present in this work.

The results demonstrate a diversity of evidence from all inhabited continents covering an extensive time frame. Following a thematic synthesis, we further explore the implications of these data for our understanding of the cultural variability and patterning of hunter-gatherer children in the deep past. We discuss possible interpretative pathways that can shed light on children's learning processes, agency, minds and bodies, use of space, and how they were embedded in social worlds.

Nevertheless, it has never been used for the stratigraphic study of historical buildings. Thus far, archaeologists and architects, the experts in archaeology of architecture, have led this research. The method consisted of visually-and, consequently, subjectively-identifying certain evidence regarding the elevations of such buildings that could be a consequence of the passage of time. In this article, we would like to present the results from one of the research projects pursued by our group, in which we automated the stratigraphic study of some historic buildings using multivariate statistic techniques. To this end, we first measured the building using surveying techniques to create a 3D model, and then, we broke down every stone into qualitative and quantitative variables. To identify the stratigraphic features on the walls, we applied machine learning by conducting different predictive and descriptive analyses. The predictive analyses were used to rule out any blocks of stone with different characteristics, such as rough stones, joint ashlars, and voussoirs of arches; these are irregularities that probably show building processes and whose identification is crucial in ascertaining the structural evolution of the building. In supervised learning, we experimented with decision trees and random forest- and although the results were good in all cases, we ultimately opted to implement the predictive model obtained using the last one. While identifying the evidence on the walls, it was also very important to identify different continuity solutions or interfaces present on them, because although these are elements without materiality, they are of great value in terms of timescale, because they delimit different strata and allow us to deduce the relationship between them.},

The method is based on graph analysis that iteratively compares and manipulates Hamming distances between graphs of input geographical parameters and graphs of human activity data in various historical periods. The weights learned from the comparison was used to build a prediction model to estimate the potential presence of an archaeological site of a certain time period in a given cadaster. This was applied in the Bohemian Moravian Highlands region based on the most complete archaeological dataset of the area. Resulting maps were analyzed from the archaeological and historical point of view to test against the existing knowledge of prehistoric population movement in the region. Overall, the method proved to overcome problems such as fragmentary inputs and is a good candidate for application in smaller and geographically diverse research areas. The aim of this work was to contribute to the methodology of the prediction of historical human activity, to facilitate greater comprehension of past local settlement dynamics, and to possibly ease the protection of cultural heritage.},

	abstract = {Butchery involves using tools to process animal carcasses during consumption of tissue packages, and this technological adaptation has a deep connection with evolving human dietary ecology. Studying butchery informs archaeological inferences about lithic artefact function and site formation and describes skeletal traces of carcass consumption, which may corroborate the butchery function of certain tools. Diverse methodologies including subjective personal observations and well-controlled experiments that investigate abstracted slicing mechanics or realistic butchery scenarios provide mixed conclusions about which kinds of tools are more efficient for butchery and whether their archaeological traces can be discriminated. Much less analytical attention is devoted to investigating whether a butcher's experience using stone tools to process carcasses impacts their performance, which may confound experimental assessment of how tool attributes are related to butchery efficiency. These experiments examine butchery performance in two novices over 40 goat forelimb and hindlimb trials where a single flake was used to deflesh and disarticulate a limb. By measuring butchery performance as defleshing efficiency (the amount of meat removed per second) and the time necessary to disarticulate limb elements, we demonstrate that in general, both butchers performed similarly when butchering forelimbs and hindlimbs and did not exhibit a strong learning curve of performance improvement. As well, flake weight, size, and cutting edge length were positively related to defleshing efficiency and negatively related to disarticulation time, suggesting that larger flakes are better butchery tools. Our results suggest that anatomical differences between forelimbs and hindlimbs did not impact butchery timing or efficiency and butchery performance is similar across novices. To maximize comparability of experimental butchery results, we encourage future research to examine butchery performance with respect to animal or tissue package size and investigate how butcher experience impacts performance.},

Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites—spanning eight millennia—at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km
              2
              area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places—the latter of which are often referred to as “tells”—we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.},

In this work, we focus on the task of recovering characters and symbols from images of corrupted archaeological artifacts where data is partially erased, occluded, or overwritten by other data. Such phenomena can be widely observed in image datasets of palimpsests and petroglyphs consisting of erased, overwritten, and in general heavily degraded data. Segmentation and binarization are typically applied to such images to detect and recover characters and symbols from their background. However, these methods mainly focus on the visible data while in our case, due to large corruption, both visible and invisible information should be considered. For example, computing the segmentation mask of an occluded character requires also labeling invisible pixels and missing parts. In this work, we introduce a deep neural network that computes character segmentation in palimpsests and petroglyphs while overcoming occlusions, missing parts, and degradation. Our network has inference abilities, thus, not only segmenting the symbol's foreground pixels but also inferring and completing missing and corrupted parts. Since palimpsests and petroglyphs have very limited annotated ground-truth data, we also introduce data augmentation tools to properly train our network. We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative performance of our method also including a user study involving expert evaluation.},

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 2 million fatalities since it first  emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection rates are at their highest point  globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious  variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene  predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to  infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order.  Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while  others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter,  analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation  among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling  effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual  strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous  results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and  suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to  SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and  endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera  Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to  Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further  understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a  conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their  exposure to SARS-CoV-2.},

Furthermore, the control of fire allowed the development of the first symbolic behavior in deep caves, around 176 ky BP. These activities would increase during the Upper Paleolithic, when lighting residues proliferated at these sites. The physical peculiarities of Paleolithic lighting resources are very poorly understood, although this is a key aspect for the study of human activity within caves and other dark contexts. In this work, we characterize the main Paleolithic lighting systems (e.g., wooden torches, portable fat lamps, and fireplaces) through empirical observations and experimental archeology in an endokarstic context. Furthermore, each lighting system's characteristic combustion residues were identified to achieve a better identification for the archaeological record. The experiments are based on an exhaustive review of archaeological information about this topic. Besides, we apply the estimated luminous data of a Paleolithic cave with Paleolithic art (Atxurra in northern Spain) in 3D through GIS technology to delve into the archeologic implications of illumination in Paleolithic underground activities.},

Which fields of history will be most and least affected? I argue for a cautious embrace of the new data about the past coming from the paleosciences, offering a few examples of the promise and perils presented by the work of our natural science and archaeology colleagues. With each passing year, the proportion of our knowledge of the past that derives from the kinds of documents we have learned to read and interpret will shrink, and the proportion that derives from what to most of us are unfamiliar sciences will mount. This has implications. First, the deeper past might make a comeback. The last century or two are the best documented and will likely be least affected by the flood. The intellectual excitement may tip toward the study of earlier centuries where relative significance of information in other formats is greater. Second, the ways in which we train historians may need to change. A possible partial guide to our future as historians is the experience of precolonial Africanists, who are accustomed to research without written documents.},

Such problems include the influence of several circumstances on GPR signal and its computer-aided interpretation. Particularly important are: 1) the progressive decomposition of the body; 2) the dressing on the body-none, summer or winter garment, or wrapped in shroud or plastic foil; and 3) the size of the body.

	abstract = {Modern elevation-determining remote sensing technologies such as light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) produce a wealth of topographic information that is increasingly being used in a wide range of disciplines, including archaeology and geomorphology. However, automated methods for mapping topographic features have remained a significant challenge. Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based user's and producer's accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while user's and producer's accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods.},

An extensive instrumentation program was conducted during construction, as well as field observations including deflection of the diaphragm walls, ground movements, pore water pressures, settlements, and rotation of the Aurelian Walls. Observed ground settlements and diaphragm wall displacements were smaller than those monitored in other case histories worldwide, inducing no damage to the Aurelian Walls.

This study presents a novel use of Machine Learning algorithms for pattern recognition techniques in the automated separation and identification of fossiliferous levels. This approach can be divided into three main steps including: (1) unsupervised Machine Learning for density based clustering (2) expert-in-the-loop Collaborative Intelligence Learning for the integration of geological data followed by (3) supervised learning for the final fine-tuning of fossiliferous level models. For evaluation of these techniques, this method was tested in two Late Miocene sites of the Batallones Butte paleontological complex (Madrid, Spain). Here we show Machine Learning analyses to be a valuable tool for the processing of spatial data in an efficient and quantitative manner, successfully identifying the presence of discrete fossiliferous levels in both Batallones-3 and Batallones-10. Three discrete fossiliferous levels have been identified in Batallones-3, whereas another three have been differentiated in Batallones-10.},

In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2\% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3\% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set. This work demonstrates the validity and robust training of the PointNet neural in underwater scenarios and its applicability for AUV intervention tasks.},

	abstract = {Many libraries, museums, and other organizations contain large collections of handwritten historical documents, for example, the papers of early presidents  like George Washington at the Library of Congress. The first step in providing  recognition/ retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into  words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm  have been mostly developed and tested on highly constrained documents like bank  checks and postal addresses. There has been little work on full handwritten pages  and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created  for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand,  contain a great deal of noise and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale  space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten (historical) documents  into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is  followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in  images. Each line image is then filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several  scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to portions of characters  at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale  selection, that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words.  This is done by finding the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the  blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three different approaches. The  blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to  recover the words. A postprocessing filtering step is performed to eliminate  boxes of unusual size which are unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is  tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown that, on 100 sampled  documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a  total error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a  state-of-the-art gap metrics word-segmentation algorithm on this collection.},

Standard processing techniques aim to remove some noise, enhance reflections of the subsurface. Next, one has to calculate the instantaneous envelope and produce C-scans which are 2D amplitude maps showing high reflectivity surfaces. These amplitude maps are mainly used for data interpretation and provide a good insight into the subsurface but cannot fully describe it. The main limitations are discussed while studies aiming to overcome them are reviewed. These studies involve integrated interpretation approaches using both B-scans and C-scans, attribute analysis, fusion approaches, and recent attempts to automatically interpret C-scans using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. To contribute to the automatic interpretation of GPR data using DL, an application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify GPR data is also presented and discussed.},

Ancient Libraries showcase a significant variability of scale, monumentality, and design with the use of different architectural components, and researchers cannot identify them as easily as other building types. The grammar is in 2D and captures all the variability of libraries from the simpler forms of the Hellenistic period to the more monumental of the Roman period, creating a vast range of designs. The paper presents the grammar-generated plans of the known libraries based on the evidence in the archaeological record. A frequency analysis of the occurrence of the rules in the derivations ranks the different characteristics of libraries and the architectural forms with which they occur in the corpus, to determine the probability of specific rules and to interpret them as mandatory or optional. The contribution of this work is that the shape grammar summarizes the design principles of ancient libraries visually and helps establish the building type of the ancient library. The frequency analysis assists tremendously in the reconstruction of fragmentarily preserved ancient libraries by providing a system in the reconstruction of the missing parts, when ambiguity is involved.},

This industry was defined based on the lithic assemblages recovered from Hagfet ed Dabba and the nearby Haua Fteah site. We studied the lithic material from Level VI of the Hagfet ed Dabba site, which was excavated by Prof. McBurney in 1949. The aim of the lithic production was to obtain blade/bladelets through bidirectional and unidirectional prismatic methods. Blanks are of two types: wide, non-curved and straight blade/bladelets and narrow and pointed blades/bladelets. The blanks were modified mostly into backed pieces/points and Chamfered pieces. We discuss the role and possible contacts of the Dabban in understanding the Later Stone Age in northern Africa and the Initial Upper Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic in the Near East. Following the technological analysis of Level VI, we consider the Early Dabban as representing an independent and local industry of the Early Later Stone Age with possible influences from the Levantine IUP and Ahmarian industries. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of direct affiliation with any of them, and the industry indeed portrays its own specific characteristics.},

An algorithm that couples a widely used sonar data processing method with a newly developed machine-learning(ML)-based algorithm was evaluated for accuracy and potential operationalisation. Data representing an operationally realistic range of environmental and data con-ditions comprised 103 500 m-by-500 m data tiles for method development/calibration and 20 tiles for validation located in the Florida Keys. Tiles are processed individually to classify each LiDAR pulse return ("sounding" in hydrographic terminology) as bathymetry or not. Compared to a reference classification an average agreement of about 90\% was produced for the calibration and validation data sets, and accuracy varied depending on ocean bottom and data conditions. The average false negative rate - the most important metric in hydrographic mapping - was about 5\%. Processing time for tiles containing the average number of soundings (seven million) on a desktop computer was approximately 100 min. The algorithm does not require in situ ground-"truth" data for training or calibration, although its adaptation to other geographic and data conditions might require data-guided adjustment of ML tuning parameters.},

Here, we analyse genome-wide data from 56 populations using new methods for tracing ancestral gene flow, focusing primarily on Island Southeast Asia. We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbour ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland. Thus, either there was once a substantial Austro-Asiatic presence in Island Southeast Asia, or Austronesian speakers migrated to and through the mainland, admixing there before continuing to western Indonesia.},

Epigenetic processes 100 million years later modified these circuits. Natural selection on similar genetic processes occurred during the evolution of archaic hominins and humans. The lungs and larynx-anatomy that produces the rhythmic fundamental frequency patterns of speech-have a deep evolutionary history. Neural circuits linking the cortex, basal ganglia, and other subcortical structures plan, sequence, and execute motor as well as cognitive acts. These neural circuits generate the rhythm of speech, singing, and chanting. The human form of the transcription factor FOXP2 increased synaptic connectivity and plasticity in basal ganglia circuits, enhancing motor control and cognitive and linguistic capabilities in humans as well as Neanderthals. The archeological record also suggests that Neanderthals passed spoken language. Homologous circuits existed in amphibians. In songbirds, the avian form of FOXP2 acted on similar neural circuits allowing birds to learn and produce new songs. Current studies point to natural selection on genetic events enhancing these and other neural circuits to yield fully human rhythmic speech, and motor, cognitive, and linguistic capabilities, rather than the saltation proposed by Noam Chomsky.},

However, little literature studied the automatic extraction of these surfaces from the 3-D SBP data currently. Thus, this article proposes a hybrid method consisting of a surface extraction algorithm and a segmentation algorithm. First, the multiprofile SBP data are converted into 3-D data volume. Second, by taking full advantage of the plate-like characteristic of the layer surface in the 3-D SBP data, a plate-like enhancement filtering algorithm based on the nonuniform Gaussian scale is given to filter the 3-D data volume. Third, a threshold extraction is applied to extract surface voxels, and a hybrid region growing algorithm is put forward to segment surface voxels into basic units by combining multicriteria. Finally, the surface segmentation problem is formulated as global energy optimization, and a stepwise segmentation algorithm is proposed to get the final surface set. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted and analyzed. The results showed that the proposed method performed well.},

Due to the significant  difference in soil Cd content and bioavailability among different parent  materials, the previous land classification scheme based on total soil Cd content  as the classification standard, has certain shortcomings. This study aims to  explore the factors influencing soil Cd bioavailability in typical karst areas of  Guilin and to suggest a scientific and effective farmland use management plan  based on the prediction model. A total of 9393 and 8883 topsoil samples were  collected from karst and non-karst areas, respectively. Meanwhile, 149 and 145  rice samples were collected together with rhizosphere soil in karst and non-karst  areas, respectively. The results showed that the higher CaO level in the karst  area was a key factor leading to elevated soil pH value. Although Cd was highly  enriched in karst soils, the higher pH value and adsorption of Mn oxidation  inhibited Cd mobility in soils. Conversely, the Cd content in non-karst soils was  lower, whereas the Cd level in rice grains was higher. To select the optimal  prediction model based on the correlation between Cd bioaccumulation factors and  geochemical parameters of soil, artificial neural network (ANN) and linear  regression prediction models were established in this study. The ANN prediction  model was more accurate than the traditional linear regression model according to  the evaluation parameters of the test set. Furthermore, a new land classification  scheme based on an ANN prediction model and soil Cd concentration is proposed in  this study, making full use of the spatial resources of farmland to ensure safe  rice consumption.},

As the remains are exposed to taphonomic processes after the death of the organism,  their physicochemical structure undergoes alterations. The success and integrity  of a DNA analysis is thus conditioned by the preservation state of the sample. In  this study, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with further data exploration was employed to  characterize the physicochemical structure of the samples and its correlation  with the preservation state of the DNA. The aim was to test the hypothesis that  ATR-FTIR-obtained spectra contain enough information to allow classification of  the samples based on the preservation of the DNA in the remains. In the study,  138 human bones and teeth originating from the 16th century BC to the 21 st  century AD were used. The samples were cleaned and powdered following the  established methodological procedures for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted and  quantified. The samples were separated into four categories based on the amount  of quantified DNA. The remaining powder was analyzed with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy  and the spectra obtained were explored to extract physicochemical information.  Before the exploration of the acquired data, samples were divided into groups A  (n = 107) and B (n = 31). Statistical analyses and machine learning were  performed on the group A samples. The protocol was then validated on the group B  samples, which served to make predictions on the preservation of the DNA in the  remains. The best results were achieved using a random forest learning algorithm  employing either normalized spectra, second-derivative spectra, or five  highest-ranked ratios. Even though overlapping remained, these findings indicate  that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with further exploration of the data has good  potential as a pre-screening method for evaluating DNA preservation in skeletal  remains.},

	doi = {10.1515/itit-2022-0007},
	abstract = {In Greek art, the phase from 900 to 700 BCE is referred to as the Geometric period due to the characteristically simple geometry-like ornamentations appearing on painted pottery surfaces during this era. Distinctive geometric patterns are typical for specific periods, regions, workshops as well as painters and are an important cue for archaeological tasks, such as dating and attribution. To date, these analyses are mostly conducted with the support of information technology. The primitives of an artefact's ornamentation can be generally classified into a set of distinguishable pattern classes, which also appear in a similar fashion on other objects. Although a taxonomy of known pattern classes is given in subject-specific publications, the automatic detection and classification of surface patterns from object depictions poses a non-trivial challenge. Our long-term goal is to provide this classification functionality using a specifically designed and trained neural network. This, however, requires a large amount of labelled training data, which at this point does not exist for this domain context. In this work, we propose an effective annotation system, which allows a domain expert to interactively segment and label parts of digitized vessel surfaces. These user inputs are constantly fed back to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), enabling the prediction of pattern classes for a given surface area with ever increasing precision. Our work paves the way for a fully automatic classification and analysis of large surface pattern collections, which, with the help of suitable visual analysis techniques, can answer research questions like pattern variability or change over time. While the capability of our proposed annotation pipeline is demonstrated at the example of two characteristic Greek pottery artefacts from the Geometric period, the proposed methods can be readily adopted for the patternation in any other chronological periods as well as for stamped motifs.},

Hence it is important to match query and annotation intervals by examining their similarity or closeness. One of the problems is that in many cases time intervals are imprecise. For example, the boundaries of the "Pre-Roman age" and the "Roman age" are inherently imprecise and it may be difficult to distinguish them with clear-cut intervals. In this paper we apply the fuzzy set theory to model imprecise time intervals in order to determine relevance of the relationship between two time intervals. We present a method for matching query and annotation intervals based on their weighted mutual overlapping and closeness. We present (1) methods for calculating these eights to produce a combined measure and (2) results of comparing the combined measure with human evaluators as a case study. The case study takes into consideration archaeological temporal information, which is in most cases inherently fuzzy, and therefore offers a particularly complex and challenging scenario. The results show that our new combined measure that utilizes different weighted measures together in rankings, performs the best in terms of precision and recall. It should be used when ranking annotation intervals according to a given query interval in cultural heritage information retrieval. Our approach intends to be generalizable: overlapping and closeness may be calculated between any two fuzzy temporal intervals. The presented procedure of using user evaluation results as a basis for assigning weights for overlapping and closeness could potentially be used to reveal weights in other domains and purposes as well.

	abstract = {While remote sensing data have long been widely used in archaeological prospection over large areas, the task of examining such data is time consuming and requires experienced and specialist analysts. However, recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular deep learning methods, open possibilities for the automated analysis of large areas of remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability and potential of supervised deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of different kinds of archaeological sites comprising features such as walls and linear or curvilinear structures of different dimensions, spectral and geometrical properties. Our work deliberately uses open-source imagery to demonstrate the accessibility of these tools. One of the main challenges facing AI approaches has been that they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high levels of accuracy so that the training stage requires significant computational resources. Our results show, however, that even with relatively limited amounts of data, simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network can be trained efficiently using minimal computational resources, to identify and classify archaeological sites and successfully distinguish them from features with similar characteristics. By increasing the number of training sets and switching to the use of high-performance computing the accuracy of the identified areas increases. We conclude by discussing the future directions and potential of such methods in archaeological research.},

	abstract = {Back pain is a common condition with a high social impact and represents a global health burden. Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is one of the major causes of  back pain; no therapeutics are currently available to reverse this disease. The  impact of bone mineral density (BMD) on IVDD has been controversial, with some  studies suggesting osteoporosis as causative for IVDD and others suggesting it as  protective for IVDD. Functional studies to evaluate the influence of genetic  components of BMD in IVDD could highlight opportunities for drug development and  repurposing. By taking a holistic 3D approach, we established an aging zebrafish  model for spontaneous IVDD. Increased BMD in aging, detected by automated  computational analysis, is caused by bone deformities at the endplates. However,  aged zebrafish spines showed changes in bone morphology, microstructure, mineral  heterogeneity, and increased fragility that resembled osteoporosis. Elements of  the discs recapitulated IVDD symptoms found in humans: the intervertebral  ligament (equivalent to the annulus fibrosus) showed disorganized collagen fibers  and herniation, while the disc center (nucleus pulposus equivalent) showed  dehydration and cellular abnormalities. We manipulated BMD in young zebrafish by  mutating sp7 and cathepsin K, leading to low and high BMD, respectively.  Remarkably, we detected IVDD in both groups, demonstrating that low BMD does not  protect against IVDD, and we found a strong correlation between high BMD and  IVDD. Deep learning was applied to high-resolution synchrotron µCT image data to  analyze osteocyte 3D lacunar distribution and morphology, revealing a role of sp7  in controlling the osteocyte lacunar 3D profile. Our findings suggest potential  avenues through which bone quality can be targeted to identify beneficial  therapeutics for IVDD.},

	abstract = {Airborne Laser Scanning (sometimes referred to as lidar) has been described as revolutionary for the understanding and management of cultural landscapes. The ability to create highly accurate three dimensional (3D) models and visualise the topographic features that represent past human interaction with the land surface has undoubtedly changed our view of the world and our approach to heritage management.

The use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) for cultural heritage management across Europe has increased greatly in the first two decades of the 21st century as data have become more widely available. While there is a growing expertise in the implementation of ALS derived visualisations for our discipline, it is clear from our survey of practitioners that this specialism is often represented by only a few experts scattered across a country. Specialist practitioners have facilitated knowledge exchange at training and networking via conferences and events such as the TRAIL (Training and Research in the Archaeological Interpretation of Lidar) meetings. However there have been few opportunities to capture the collective understanding of how to make the most of ALS for cultural heritage management that has developed over the last two decades.

The aim of these guidelines, instigated by the European Archaeological Council (EAC), is to bring together for the first time a reference document that combines the experience of colleagues across Europe.  The guidelines have been designed fully collaboratively by an extensive network of cultural heritage professionals. The foundation was an online survey conducted in 2022 to which more than 100 individuals and organisations from across 30 countries responded, detailing the status quo and their needs and aspirations with respect to integrating ALS data into their work. Using the results of this baseline survey to define the requirements of the wider community, 49 co-authors worked together to design the structure and content of the guidelines, in doing so ensuring their relevance and impact. The development of the guidelines was undertaken entirely online in Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023, an approach that has paid dividends in the quality and relevance of the end product by facilitating the input of so many experts from across the continent.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning models are gaining in popularity they remain subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.},

Linked software and database solutions enable unsupervised machine learning to cluster shapes based on similarity, eventually assisting typological analysis. Following an overview of current practices in ceramic recording and both standard and computational shape classification analyses, the new approach is discussed in full as a documentary and analytical tool. A case study from the Middle and Late Bronze Age site of Kaymakci in western Anatolia demonstrates the benefits of the recording method and helps show that a combination of automated and manual shape clustering techniques currently remains the best practice in ceramic shape classification.},

	abstract = {Background: The archaeological and ethnographic heritages of Mongolia reflect a multi-millennial continuity of typically mobile-pastoral occupations across sparsely populated, environmentally diverse landscapes, but the threats of modernisation and industrialisation to those heritages are nevertheless present and substantial. The construction of the Erdeneburen Hydroelectric Dam on the Khovd River in western Mongolia is planned to submerge hundreds of archaeological features and jeopardise at least another thousand. Methods: The Mongolian Archaeology Project: Surveying the Steppes, in collaboration with the Mongolian Institute of Archaeology, integrates a variety of digital techniques including GIS (geographic information systems), Machine Learning automated site detection, drone mapping, and Structure-from-Motion LiDAR scanning to document the endangered archaeology. This paper presents the resulting dataset of archaeological features across three different impact zones associated with the dam construction and evaluates the degree of efficacy of the initial data integration strategy through informal partner feedback and self-assessment. Results: While only approximately 20\% of the documented sites fall within the planned flood zone, the remaining sites will be subjected to collateral threats such as industrial and infrastructural development that will necessitate extended monitoring, both temporally and spatially. In consideration of these results, this paper argues that a ‘responsive’ mode of heritage disaster intervention can bridge the gap between ‘reactive’ and ‘proactive’ modes, but requires development of an integrated (digital) methodology. Conclusions : The paper concludes by offering a new, more interconnected ‘transmethodology’ that addresses spatiality, sub-sampling, data reuse, and community input across multiple disciplines such as cultural heritage preservation, salvage archaeology, computer vision, and community archaeology. The authors developed this ‘transmethodology’ and the resulting workflows out of a theoretical framework that considers principles of Symmetrical Archaeology, Resilience Humanitarianism, and the CARE standard for inclusive data management (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics).},

	abstract = {The current archaeological work in China has the problems of high cost, large material consumption, more attention on human detection and long time-consuming. It is urgent to use modern high-precision detection technology for auxiliary work. This exploration will also use the semantic recognition system based on deep learning and neural network for the recognition of oracle bone inscriptions in archaeology. Therefore, combined with the concept of multimedia semantic recognition and analysis, a unified real-time target detection semantic analysis model named You Only Look Once (YOLOv2) is established based on the deep convolutional neural network under deep learning in the field of machine learning, to test the semantic analysis of oracle bone inscriptions. Moreover, Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and traditional YOLO models are selected to conduct the controlled experiments. A YOLOv2 recognition system is established based on Diffusion-Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) under deep learning. First, the concept and performance of DCNN are studied. Next, the basic information of oracle bone inscriptions is analyzed. A recognition system based on DCNN is established. On the premise that the three models can identify different directions of the same oracle bone inscriptions sample, the detection accuracy and detection loss value of YOLOv2 are better than those of the other two models, the detection accuracy is as high as 0.90, and the loss value is less than 0.10. Therefore, it is considered that this YOLOv2 semantic analysis model can be applied in oracle bone inscriptions and other archaeological work, which improves the work efficiency and simplifies the human work items for the domestic archaeological work. This semantic analysis model is of great help to the pattern recognition of cultural relics in archaeological work, and can help professionals analyze the meaning of patterns faster when there are massive similar oracle bone inscriptions.},

In this article, we will focus on a particular case study: the field of paleoanthropology, which seeks to understand the evolution of the human species based on biological (e.g., bones, genetics) and cultural (e.g., stone tools) evidence. As we will show, the easy availability of ML algorithms and lack of expertise on their proper use among the anthropological research community has led to the foundational misapplications that have appeared throughout the literature. The resulting unreliable results not only undermine efforts to legitimately incorporate ML into anthropological research, but produce potentially faulty understandings about our human evolutionary and behavioral past. The aim of this article is to provide a brief introduction to some of the ways in which ML has been applied within paleoanthropology; we also include a survey of some basic ML algorithms for those who are not fully conversant with the field, which remains under active development. We discuss a series of missteps, errors, and violations of correct protocols of ML methods that appear disconcertingly often within the accumulating body of anthropological literature. These mistakes include the use of outdated algorithms and practices; inappropriate testing/training splits, sample composition, and textual explanations; as well as an absence of transparency due to the lack of data/code sharing, and the subsequent limitations imposed on independent replication. We assert that expanding samples, sharing data and code, re-evaluating approaches to peer review, and, most importantly, developing interdisciplinary teams that include experts in ML are all necessary for the progress in future research incorporating ML within anthropology and beyond.},

	abstract = {Mesopotamia is often seen as a region limited in resources, for example wood and minerals, while its peripheries Taurus, Zagros Mountains their foothills and the Levant region are very resourceful. This traditional vision led to the concept of “resource hunting” in which Mesopotamian empires would have spread to these regions to monopolize their resources. SFB 1070 aims to define new patterns by including resources in a wider spectrum as cultural elements not only for Mesopotamian empires but also for local communities. This new concept is called ResourceCultures. We investigate these issues in an archaeological and geoarchaeological survey covering an area of 4.400 km2 from the western foothills of the Zagros mountains to the eastern riverbank of the Tigris.

We analyzed more than 500 archaeological sites or installations detected in the survey zone from 2013 to 2019 by the German expedition of the SFB 1070 to unravel the patterns that determine a ResourceCulture and its underlying complex relation of resources. In order to find which features (water, topography, soil type, resources availability, vegetation, and others) influenced the founding and location of settlements, we analyze the feature importance for different landscape zones and time periods. To do so, we apply machine learning models inspired by predictive archaeology. These models will potentially help to better understand how resources were used in a cultural context through time and space.

This poster aims to present preliminary ideas derived from the machine learning approach: What trends appear and what are their possible interpretations? How can we use these interpretations to define the ResourceCultures in Northern Mesopotamia?},

	abstract = {Multimedia information processing course includes image processing, text processing, video processing, audio processing, graphics, and animation. Classical multimedia information processing course is to lecture these contents as independent course units, making the course teaching inconsistently and student's learning interest and attention lost easily. Archaeology is a cross-disciplinary field, where an archaeological research project needs to use a variety of multimedia information processing technologies. This paper introduces a novel cross-disciplinary course teaching approach to combine traditional multimedia information processing techniques with archaeological research content in the new engineering era, which increases students' attention and interest in the multimedia information processing course. Teaming up with the archaeology professor, we present two multimedia-archaeology projects: intelligent pottery fragments splicing and intelligent Oracle inscription recognition. We have addressed a few challenges in our courses: 1) how to guide students efficiently to implement different project contents, e.g., using the scanner to acquire three-dimensional porcelain fragment data skillfully. 2) How to inspire students to learn and use various multimedia processing technologies and archaeology knowledge. 3) How the teacher adapts the teaching content according to the dynamic interests of the students. To address these challenges, students are grouped into two project teams based on their strengths and interests. We introduce collaborative learning and active learning strategies to help students learn and use different knowledge and address project problems and learning problems. We also invite the archaeological professor to teach basic archaeology knowledge in the class. Furthermore, to better understand the students' learning situation, we present a weekly project progress report approach, which can also help the teacher adjust the teaching content. This teaching approach can enhance the continuity of multimedia information processing teaching and stimulate students' enthusiasm and creativity in learning. Moreover, it can deepen the cultural atmosphere of the teaching in an engineering course.},

	abstract = {For the first time in Russia, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and related analytical techniques were used to determine the distribution patterns of elemental composition in archeological pottery in terms of classification and provenance of medieval pottery. A total of 48 fragments have been discovered in three locations; Bolgar, the Moscow Kremlin (MosKremlin), and Selitrennoe settlement (Selitrennoe). The assemblages were subjected to INAA in order to determine the concentrations of 37 elements in mg/kg. The data were analyzed using geochemical, bivariate, and multivariate statistical techniques. To classify the fragments according to their origin hierarchical clustering (HCA), linear discriminant (LDA), and principal component analyses (PCA) were used. Based on the INAA results, the first attempt was made to apply machine learning methods to the study of artifacts in Russia. The results show that they are reliable and powerful in extracting information about critical elements for identifying ceramic fragments and using them as chemical fingerprints. Chromium was the most useful element and was used in conjunction with other elements as a fingerprint to distinguish sherds. Chemical and statistical analyses help to establish of reference groups for medieval archeological pottery, which will be used in the future to classify and identify various unknown sherds. These reference groups serve as baseline data for determining the fragment's place of manufacture and are considered a reasonable judgment based on experimental data.},

Machine learning methods and artificial neural networks, especially linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, while determining the gender, machine learning also were technically adopted. 13 different machine learning algorithms were used as a model for gender determination. Many tools were designed to perform processes like designing necessary bookmarks to try models, designing measurements where machine learning algorithms are used as features, determining coordinates of designed bookmarks, and computation of features. A software named Sekazu was developed by presenting an integrated solution proposal.

In this imaging study, we show that extended field of view synchrotron radiation-based tomography provides true micrometer resolution and coverage for non-destructively surveying for incremental lines. To rapidly review the root cementum layer of four teeth from early 19th century cemetery with historical records of life events, we employed machine learning for semi-automatic detection and analysis of incremental lines. Surveying large regions of the root cementum enables detection of incremental lines and hence improves TCA analysis as an alternative to slicing of the unique teeth.},

It introduces a machine learning approach to the automatic identification of potential archaeological sites from AUV-obtained side-scan sonar (SSS) data. The site identification pipeline consists of a series of stages that set up for, run, and process the output of a convolutional neural network (CNN). To alleviate the issue of training data scarcity, i.e. the lack of SSS data that includes shipwrecks, and improve the performance at testing time, a data augmentation stage is included in the pipeline. In addition, edge detection and other traditional image processing feature extraction methods are used in parallel with CNN to improve algorithmic performance. Experiments from two multi-deployment shipwreck search expeditions involving actual AUV deployments along the coast of Malta for data collection and processing demonstrate the pipeline’s usefulness. Results from these two field expeditions yielded a precision/recall of 29.34\%/97.22\% and 32.95\%/80.39\%, respectively. Despite the poor precision, the pipeline filters out 99.79\% of the area in data set A and 99.31\% of the area in data set B.},

A generalized low rank model (GLRM) was used to impute missing data and Area under the Curve—Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) with 20-fold stratified cross-validation was used to evaluate predictive performance of eight machine learning algorithms on different subsets of the data. Additional perspectives such as this one show strong potential for sex prediction in bioarchaeological and forensic anthropological contexts. Furthermore, GLRMs have the potential to handle missing data in ways previously unexplored in the discipline. Although results of this study look promising (highest AUC-ROC = 0.9722 for predicting binary male/female sex), the main limitation is that the sexes of the individuals included were not known but were estimated using standard macroscopic bioarchaeological methods. However, future research should apply this machine learning approach to known-sex reference samples in order to better understand its value, along with the more general contributions that machine learning can make to the reconstruction of past human lifeways.},

            Deep learning is a powerful tool for exploring large datasets and discovering new patterns. This work presents an account of a metric learning-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to an archaeological dataset. The proposed account speaks of three stages: training, testing/validating, and community detection. Several thousand artefact images, ranging from the Lower Palaeolithic period (1.4 million years ago) to the Late Islamic period (fourteenth century AD), were used to train the model (i.e., the CNN), to discern artefacts by site and period. After training, it attained a comparable accuracy to archaeologists in various periods. In order to test the model, it was called to identify new query images according to similarities with known (training) images. Validation blinding experiments showed that while archaeologists performed as well as the model within their field of expertise, they fell behind concerning other periods. Lastly, a community detection algorithm based on the confusion matrix data was used to discern affiliations across sites. A case-study on Levantine Natufian artefacts demonstrated the algorithm’s capacity to discern meaningful connections. As such, the model has the potential to reveal yet unknown patterns in archaeological data.},

	abstract = {One of the essential industrial sectors in India is Agriculture and the economy of a country is relied on it highly for sustainability in rural areas. The Indian agriculture level reduces gradually owing to some factors like excessive utilization of pesticides, water level decrement, climate changes, and unpredicted rainfall, etc. On the agriculture data, descriptive analysis is performed to understand the production level. Because of lack of ecosystem control technologies deployment, most of the agriculture fields are under developed. The production of crops is not increased owing to these issues that affects the economy of agriculture. Based on the prediction of plant yield, agricultural productivity is improved. By using machine learning techniques, the crop from given dataset have to predict by agricultural sectors for preventing this issue. To capture the information, the dataset analyses by supervised machine learning technique (SMLT). The effectiveness of proposed method of machine learning algorithm can compare with best accuracy based on the results. In this paper use ANN with cascade-forward backpropagation and Elman backpropagation for yield prediction. To determine input variables that maximize the interested neurons’ activation, the positive gradients backpropagate by Cascade-Forward backpropagation method. A recurrent connection exists from the hidden layer output to its input is included in Elman backpropagation network which is a two layer backpropagation network. These two techniques are better prediction techniques compared to ANN with backpropagation.

Machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors classifier help solve this problem by providing high accuracy performance. K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the machine learning algorithms used to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the mammogram. This paper reviews some recent studies that highlight K-Nearest Neighbors accuracy, as a machine learning algorithm, in diagnosing cancer of breast.},

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning approaches have been used to classify and extract style from media and have been used to reinforce known chronologies from classical art history. In this work we employ the first ever machine learning analysis of Australian rock art using a data efficient transfer learning approach to identify features suitable for distinguishing styles of rock art. These features are evaluated in a one-shot learning setting. Results demonstrate that known Arnhem Land Rock art styles can be resolved without knowledge of prior groupings. We then analyse the activation space of learned features and report on the relationships between styles and arrange these classes into a stylistic chronology based on distance within the activation space. By generating a stylistic chronology, it is shown that the model is sensitive to both temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of rock art in the Arnhem Land Plateau region. More broadly, this approach is ideally suited to evaluating style within any material culture assemblage and overcomes the common constraint of small training data sets in archaeological machine learning studies.},

	abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) contain end products of stellar evolution (neutron stars, black holes, and white dwarfs) found in X-ray binaries of various types as well as in isolation. Identifying the types of these compact objects and their binary companions, and comparing their properties with the properties of the host clusters sheds light on stellar evolution, properties of SN explosions, evolution of tight binaries, and dynamical interactions in crowded environments. Pursuing these diverse and exciting science topics requires confident classifications of large numbers of X-ray sources in GCs. Since most of these sources are faint and GCs are very crowded, the HST data are required to perform reliable matching and classifications. We propose to build upon the results of previous studies to produce a training dataset from confidently classified X-ray sources in all GCs which will include multiwavelength properties measured with HST and Chandra. We will also adopt an existing automated (machine-learning) multiwavelength classification pipeline to the GCs environments and perform classifications for all X-ray sources in 3 massive GCs with deep Chandra and milti-band, multi-epoch HST observations. In this project we will test a novel machine learning approach and verify it against the traditional classification methods. We will also perform a comprehensive census of all previously classified X-ray sources in all GCs observed by CXO and HST. The corresponding database will serve as a training dataset for the classification pipeline. The database and the classification pipeline will be released to the public to aid with classification of X-ray sources in other GCs.},

This has led many intellectuals and scientists to think creatively of ways to eradicate its negative effects. Accordingly, many people have been referring to this pandemic on social media and other media outlets. Within this reference, people have given a lot of data and predictions. Computer intelligence and digital analysis is also one of the fields that has taken this into consideration using clustering algorithms. Clustering can be defined as an approach to place identical data in one community or cluster and separate unsimilar data in another group. There are many Clustering algorithms used for clustering COVID-19 Pandemic datasets. The aims of this paper are to give an overview of the clustering algorithms used in case of COVID-19 datasets, to show how these algorithms help to provide accuracy for clustering the COVID-19 Pandemic, and provide an explanation of the algorithms used for the purpose of either lessening or controlling COVID-19 that are discussed in different papers. Moreover, it details the datasets in terms of different variables like temperature, countries, media outlets including social media, and present the findings of these papers, and which clustering algorithms used and the accuracy of these algorithms. It is found out from the present overview that the clustering algorithm k-means is used widely in different types of the COVID-19 datasets with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {A key development in archaeology is the increasing agency of the digital tools brought to bear on archaeological practice. Roles and tasks that were previously thought to be uncomputable are beginning to be digitalized, and the presumption that computerization is best suited to well-defined and restricted tasks is starting to break down. Many of these digital devices seek to reduce routinized and repetitive work in the office environment and in the field. Others incorporate data-driven methods to represent, store, and manipulate information in order to undertake tasks previously thought to be incapable of being automated. Still others substitute the human component in environments which would be otherwise be inaccessible or dangerous. Whichever applies, separately or in combination, such technologies are typically seen as black-boxing practice with often little or no human intervention beyond the allocation of their inputs and subsequent incorporation of their outputs in analyses. This paper addresses the implications of this shift to algorithmic automated practices for archaeology and asks whether there are limits to algorithmic agency within archaeology. In doing so, it highlights several challenges related to the relationship between archaeologists and their digital devices.},

The detected targets are conservatively vetted to produce a total of 158,505 oscillating red giants, which is an order of magnitude increase over the yield from Kepler and K2 and a lower limit to the possible yield of oscillating giants across TESS’s nominal mission. For each detected target, we report effective temperatures and radii derived from colors and Gaia parallaxes, as well as estimates of their frequency at maximum oscillation power. Using our measurements, we present the first near all-sky Gaia-asteroseismology mass map, which shows global structures consistent with the expected stellar populations of our Galaxy. To demonstrate the strong potential of TESS asteroseismology for Galactic archeology even with only one month of observations, we identify 354 new candidates for oscillating giants in the Galactic halo, display the vertical mass gradient of the Milky Way disk, and visualize correlations of stellar masses with kinematic phase-space substructures, velocity dispersions, and α-abundances.},

Specific age estimation is mandatory for living and dead individuals, especially in young adolescents and children. Diverse detection of dental age schemes is calculated though they have certain limitations, such as reliability and prediction accuracy. To resolve this, a modified extreme learning machine with sparse representation classification (MELM-SRC) is used with dental image in this work. Initially, input image is preprocessed for reducing noise and smoothing in image using an anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF). Subsequently, teeth images are segmented using active contour model (ACM) with Jaya optimisation (JO) and then morphological post processing has been applied on segmented result to progress classification accuracy. Next, certain features are extracted such as area, perimeter, solidity, diameter, major and minor axis length, and filled area to enhance prediction accuracy. Lastly, age has been classified with MELM-SRC. In this MELM, effectual features are classified using SRC to increase age classification accuracy. Simulation outcomes show anticipated MELM-SRC acquires superior performance than Demirjian method for dental age assessment and also other existing classification schemes such as radial basis function network (RBFN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) schemes.},

Moreover, the methods used to date for archaeological prospection are limited to detecting objects and cannot (semi-)automatically characterize the structures of interest. In this study, we assess the contribution of deep learning methods for detecting and characterizing archeological structures by performing object segmentation using a deep CNN approach with transfer learning. The approach was applied to a terrain visualization image derived from airborne LiDAR data within a 200 km² area in Brittany, France. Our study reveals that the approach can accurately (semi-)automatically detect, delineate, and characterize topographic anomalies, and thus provides an effective tool to inventory many archaeological structures.

We use this calibration to assess the root-zone soil moisture for the period 2001–2018.

	abstract = {Abstract. Airborne LiDAR technology has become an essential tool in archaeology during the last two decades since it allows archaeologists to measure and map items or structures that would otherwise be hidden under vegetation. In order to detect and characterise the archaeological evidence, it is a common practice to extract accurate digital terrain models (DTM) by filtering out the vegetation from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) datasets. Although previous approaches have performed well in ALS filtration, they are still subject to several variables (flight height, forest cover, type of sensors utilised, etc.) and are frequently integrated into expensive commercial software or customised for specific locations. This study presents a workflow for treating ALS archaeological datasets using machine learning algorithms for both filtering the vegetation and detecting hidden structures. The workflow is applied to two different archaeological environments (in terms of structures, vegetation, landscape, point density), and results demonstrate that the pipeline is rapid and accurate, and the prediction model is transferable.},

We applied incremental dentine analysis, measuring the δ15N and δ13C in collagen from first permanent molars of 45 adult individuals from the city of Thessaloniki (4th c. BC - 16th c. AD). We were able to reconstruct the diet of 31 individuals from birth up to the age of seven. To this dataset, we added 20 previously published individuals from the same site and we re-examined the weaning ages with WEAN, an automated application for estimating the weaning age based on the measurements of δ15N. Furthermore, we used the k-means machine learning method to discern clusters of different isotopic patterns in the individual profiles and trace possible signals of physiological stress.

Our results show that 45 out of 51 individuals were breastfed but weaned at different ages ranging from one to three years old. Five individuals were breastfed for an even shorter period or were never breastfed. The weaning diet was comprised mostly of animal protein and C3 plants, while the consumption of small fish and/or C4 plants intensified from the Roman period onwards. There were no statistically significant differences between males and females and among chronological periods. Based on the machine learning approach we could identify 9 individuals with probable evidence of physiological stress, which may be linked to maladaptive breastfeeding patterns. Our study reports new data on breastfeeding and weaning utilizing the implementation of computational methods and illustrates the complexity of the infant feeding practices in ancient societies.},

The key challenge of this field is in the inherent nature of the objects; they occur in small numbers, are sparsely located and feature a unique pattern on the different remote sensing data modalities. To this extent we identify three main contributions, (1) to include multi-sensor data, (2) to optimise Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for small datasets and, (3) to optimise detection of the sparsely located objects. Our results demonstrate that deep learning can be successfully applied to detect archaeological sites on each of the individual remote sensing images, that our efforts to optimise CNNs for small datasets are successful, and that we have discovered new sites that were missed in a manual data analysis and field survey. We have optimised a workflow for the detection of new archaeological sites.

The International Space Station Archaeological Project (ISSAP) aims to extend the purview of archaeology, and provide critical insights about humanity as it moves into the wider solar system.

So far there have been no substantive analyses of data collected from space sites. The principal obstacle to carrying out an archaeological study of a site in space, whether in low Earth orbit or on the surface of another planetary body, is the multi-million-dollar price tag of fieldwork. We have developed a new methodology to allow analysis of sociocultural aspects of life on ISS. These methods are re-imaginings of traditional archaeological practice. The research program includes the following components:
1. Image analysis: using machine learning to catalogue associations between crew members, spaces within the station, and objects/tools.
2. Development of procedures for ISS crew to perform archaeological surveys on-site.
3. Investigation of ISS cargo return (“de-integration”) activity, and analysis of the values and meanings associated with returned items.},

	abstract = {As surely as the prison industrial complex developed in the wake of US chattel slavery, the twenty-first century digital subject is an object of surveillance, commoditization, simulation, mediation, and algorithms that extend slavery’s information-management, control, and representational strategies. This project conceptualizes the roles that information and data processing played in dehumanizing captured Africans and their descendants, and also proposes a more than analogous relationship between US chattel slavery and contemporary, technologically-determined, social configurations. The resulting centuries-spanning complex, what I call Immaculate Slavery, connects past to future, and Africa’s Gold Coast to California’s Silicon Valley. This interdisciplinary project braids various threads of media history, Black studies, materialist philosophy, Internet culture, and software engineering methodology. I analyze how chattel slavery’s anti-Black stereotypes and ideological concepts survived Abolition to inhabit and animate artifacts of symbolic slavery: derogatory literary caricatures, cartoons, toys, corporate mascots like Aunt Jemima, and household objects. This material and media culture has been supplanted by digital objects such as racist animated GIFs, avatars that perpetuate anti-Black stereotypes, and photorealistic Black digital puppets created for cinematic visual effects and video games. I attend to the ways that a historical Black reliance on “positive” media representations in media such as film and comic books is destabilized by the use of Black avatars and other racial prosthetics online, and by media that ostensibly criticizes Immaculate Slavery through the depiction of traumatized Black characters. I argue that even though the presence of Black characters can often counter anti-Black stereotypes, they do not always function as objects of symbolic liberation. Instead of portraying the agency and creativity that facilitated Black survival to complicate these dystopian narratives, Black characters are reduced to Black Digital Icons that are deployed to shock and horrify the audience, thereby revisiting the horrors of slavery via technology-driven allegories. As a result, Immaculate Slavery is portrayed as inescapable and if a Black character can’t escape in a work of fiction that is supposed to criticize reality, then neither can those who live the reality that is being subject to criticism. Ultimately, I propose the conception of alternative forms of Black cybernetic subjectivity that, on the one hand are not based on many-to-one representations (hero identification), and on the other not dissolved in the many-to-many representations of social media. The Black avatar as I am imagining it is not an anthropomorphic representation of an idealized protagonist or social configuration, but an interface for massively complex software objects that are built with Black-aligned storytelling platforms, design tools, GitHub repositories, Stack Exchanges, programming languages, database schemas, and machine learning algorithms. This project does not imagine a “separate but equal” cyberspace, but a separate and radically different one.},

	abstract = {Archaeological heritage in the Near East is under an ever increasing threat from multiple vectors such as looting and systematic destruction, militarization, and uncontrolled urban expansion in the absence of governmental control among others. Physically monitoring endangered sites proves to be infeasible due to the dangerous ground conditions on the one hand, and the vast area of land on which they are dispersed. In recent years, the abundant availability of Very High Resolution (VHR) imaging satellites with short revisit times meant that it was possible to monitor a large portion of these sites from space. However, such images are relatively expensive and beyond the means of many researchers and concerned local authorities. In this paper, I present an approach that uses open source data from two of the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Copernicus Constellation, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 in order to generate disturbance patches, from which looting and destruction areas are classified using Machine Learning. Such an approach opens the door towards sustainable monitoring over large swaths of land over long periods of time.},

	abstract = {Changes in land-use and land-cover, including both agricultural expansion and the establishment of protected areas, have altered the landscape pattern and extent of forest and wetland cover in the tropics. In Central America, land-use and land-cover change is also threatening the cultural resources of the region’s ancient Maya heritage since many ancient sites have been degraded by burning, deforestation, and plowing. In this study of Orange Walk District of northern Belize, from the 1980s to the present, we used multitemporal Landsat data with a random forest classifier to reveal trends in land-use and land-cover change and the increasing loss of forest and wetlands. We develop a random forest classifier that is time-generalized to map land-use and land-cover across the entire Landsat record, including Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8, with a single algorithm. Including multiyear and seasonal composites was important for obtaining cloud-free coverage and distinguishing between different land-use and land-cover types. Early deforestation (1984–1987) was in small patches scattered across the landscape and likely driven by small scale agriculture such as milpa and smaller area tractor and horse-drawn plowing. The establishment of protected areas in the late 1980s and early 1990s allowed for forest regrowth in these areas, while wetland losses were high at 15\%. The transition to industrial agriculture in the 2000s, however, drove a 43.6\% expansion of agriculture and a 7.5\% loss of forest and a 28.2\% loss of wetlands during the {\textasciitilde}15 years. Protected areas initiated in the 1980s led to a nearly 100 km2 decrease in agriculture from 1984–1987 to 1999–2001, and they became essential refugia for habitat and maintaining ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Background Wildfires of uncharacteristic severity, a consequence of climate changes and accumulated fuels, can cause amplified or novel impacts to archaeological resources. The archaeological record includes physical features associated with human activity; these exist within ecological landscapes and provide a unique long-term perspective on human-environment interactions. The potential for fire-caused damage to archaeological materials is of major concern because these resources are irreplaceable and non-renewable, have social or religious significance for living peoples, and are protected by an extensive body of legislation. Although previous studies have modeled ecological burn severity as a function of environmental setting and climate, the fidelity of these variables as predictors of archaeological fire effects has not been evaluated. This study, focused on prehistoric archaeological sites in a fire-prone and archaeologically rich landscape in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico, USA, identified the environmental and climate variables that best predict observed fire severity and fire effects to archaeological features and artifacts. Results Machine learning models (Random Forest) indicate that topography and variables related to pre-fire weather and fuel condition are important predictors of fire effects and severity at archaeological sites. Fire effects were more likely to be present when fire-season weather was warmer and drier than average and within sites located in sloped, treed settings. Topographic predictors were highly important for distinguishing unburned, moderate, and high site burn severity as classified in post-fire archaeological assessments. High-severity impacts were more likely at archaeological sites with southern orientation or on warmer, steeper, slopes with less accumulated surface moisture, likely associated with lower fuel moistures and high potential for spreading fire. Conclusions Models for predicting where and when fires may negatively affect the archaeological record can be used to prioritize fuel treatments, inform fire management plans, and guide post-fire rehabilitation efforts, thus aiding in cultural resource preservation.},

The objective of this work is divided in two steps: i) to test techniques for the semi-automatic identification of crop marks in a study zone, in Salvada, Portugal, and; ii) to develop a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) open-source application, named ArchMarks, under QGIS software, to enhance the identification of archaeological crop marks using RS data/techniques, integrating the automatic creation of indices and the identification techniques tested before. ArchMarks aims to compute several vegetation and soil indices from multispectral imagery considering four bands (Red, Green and Blue and Near InfraRed (NIR)) for enhancing the identification of archaeological crop marks. In order to define the best approach to implement in the plugin, some tests were performed with two algorithms available in QGIS: ContrastEnhancement and WatershedSegmentation. High-resolution aerial imagery (25-50 cm spatial resolution) was obtained from Web Map Service (WMS) services in addition to Sentinel-2 satellite image, whose spatial resolution is of 10 meters in the Red Green Blue-Near InfraRed bands. The application is free and can be adapted to other region of interest. In the future, the plugin will be improved with a methodology to download remote sensing data (aerial images and satellite data) from WMS sources, band stacking, and machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to automatically classify archaeological traces on the vegetation or bare soil.},

We reconstruct a superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning. We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic variation. We highlight a broad initial sweep of new empirical insights relating to trade-offs between fairness criteria, performance of algorithmic interventions, and the role of distribution shift based on our new datasets.

In this work, we are interested in the analysis and classification of ceramic sherds tomographic images in order to help archaeologists in learning about the fabrication processes of ancient pottery. More specifically, a particular manufacturing process (spiral patchwork) has recently been discovered in early Neolithic Mediterranean sites, along with a more traditional coiling technique. It has been shown that the ceramic pore distribution in available tomographic images of both archaeological and experimental samples can reveal which manufacturing technique was used. Indeed, with the spiral patchwork, the pores exhibit spiral-like behaviours, whereas with the traditional one, they are distributed along parallel lines, especially in the experimental samples. However, in archaeological samples, these distributions are very noisy, making analysis and discrimination hard to process. Here, we investigate how Learning Methods (Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine) can be used to answer these numerically difficult problems. In particular, we study how the results depend on the input data (either raw data at the output of the tomographic device, or after a preliminary pore segmentation step), and the quality of the information they could provide to archaeologists.},

Many of these examinations have focused on the contents of machine learning datasets, finding glaring underrepresentation of minoritized groups. In contrast, relatively little work has been done to examine the norms, values, and assumptions embedded in these datasets. In this work, we conceptualize machine learning datasets as a type of informational infrastructure, and motivate a genealogy as method in examining the histories and modes of constitution at play in their creation. We present a critical history of ImageNet as an exemplar, utilizing critical discourse analysis of major texts around ImageNet’s creation and impact. We find that assumptions around ImageNet and other large computer vision datasets more generally rely on three themes: the aggregation and accumulation of more data, the computational construction of meaning, and making certain types of data labor invisible. By tracing the discourses that surround this influential benchmark, we contribute to the ongoing development of the standards and norms around data development in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.},

Over the past 20 years, the reliability of these methods has vastly improved, and the total number of practitioners has been increasing. Nonetheless, much of the work conducted, to date, focuses almost exclusively on specific topographic features and monumental architecture, ignoring the potential of automation to readily assess more ephemeral components of the archaeological record. Likewise, the emphasis on specific feature types overlooks broader landscape patterns, thus delegating automated remote sensing analysis as a method in and of itself, mostly disconnected from larger archaeological and anthropological investigations. Here, I review recent attempts to rectify this shortcoming by using automated analysis methods to record and explain ephemeral archaeological material distributions. While such research is limited, I argue that the successes achieved in these recent studies offer a pathway forward for automated remote sensing to become more fully integrated with archaeological work beyond the detection of specific topographically distinct features.},

We carefully construct a training set to minimize bias and apply BINGO to a stellar population that is similar to our training set. We then select the 17 305 stars with ages from BINGO and reliable kinematic properties obtained from Gaia DR2. By combining the age and chemo-kinematical information, we dissect the Galactic disc stars into three components, namely the thick disc (old, high-[α/Fe], [α/Fe] ≳ 0.12), the thin disc (young, low-[α/Fe]), and the Bridge, which is a region between the thick and thin discs. Our results indicate that the thick disc formed at an early epoch only in the inner region, and the inner disc smoothly transforms to the thin disc. We found that the outer disc follows a different chemical evolution pathway from the inner disc. The outer metal-poor stars only start forming after the compact thick disc phase has completed and the star-forming gas disc extended outwardly with metal-poor gas accretion. We found that in the Bridge region the range of [Fe/H] becomes wider with decreasing age, which suggests that the Bridge region corresponds to the transition phase from the smaller chemically well-mixed thick to a larger thin disc with a metallicity gradient.},

Namely, we applied Random Forest, an ensemble learning method based on decision trees, to perform archaeological predictive modeling (APM) for the Canton of Zurich, in Switzerland. This was done based on a dataset of known archaeological sites dating back to the Roman Age. The APM represents an automated decision-making and probabilistic reasoning tool that is relevant for archaeological risk assessment and cultural heritage management. Machine learning-based approaches can learn from data and make predictions, starting from the acquired knowledge, through the modeling of the hidden relationships between a set of observations, representing the dependent variable (i.e. the archeological sites), and the independent variables (i.e. the geo-environmental features prone to influence the site locations). The main objective of the present study is to assess the spatial probability of presence for Roman settlements within the study area. As results, we produced: 1) a probability map, expressing the likelihood of finding a Roman site at different locations; 2) the importance ranking of the geo-environmental features influencing the presence of the archeological sites. These outputs in our results are of paramount importance, not only in verifying the reliability of the data, but also in stimulating experts in different ways. Also, these results help evaluate the benefits and constraints of using such innovative techniques and, ultimately, help explore the performance of machine learning-based models in processing archaeological information.},

	abstract = {The Andes are a unique geological and biogeographic feature of South America. From the perspective of human geography, this mountain range provides ready access to highly diverse altitudinally arranged ecosystems. The combination of a geologically and ecologically diverse landscape provides an exceptional context to explore the potential of strontium isotopes to track the movements of people and the conveyance of material culture. Here we develop an isotopic landscape of bioavailable strontium (87Sr/86Sr) that is applied to reconstruct human paleogeography across time in the southern Andes of Argentina and Chile (31 degrees-34 degrees S). These results come from a macro-regional sampling of rodents (N = 65) and plants (N = 26) from modern and archeological contexts. This "Southern Andean Strontium Transect" extends over 350 km across the Andes, encompassing the main geological provinces between the Pacific coast (Chile) and the eastern lowlands (Argentina). We follow a recently developed approach to isoscape construction based on Random Forest regression and GIS analysis. Our results suggest that bioavailable strontium is tightly linked with bedrock geology and offers a highly resolved proxy to track human paleogeography involving the levels of territories or daily mobility and anomalous events that disrupt home ranges, such as migration. The southern Andes provide an ideal geological setting to develop this approach, since the geological variation in rock age and composition produces distinctive isotopic signatures for each main biogeographical region. Finally, we apply this framework to a set of results from human remains from the Uspallata Valley in Mendoza (Argentina), to assess the incidence of migration in the key period of the consolidation of agropastoral economies between AD 800 and 1400. The application of the isoscape to the values from human remains confirms the persistence of human groups with relatively restricted territories encompassing Uspallata and the adjacent Precordillera between AD 800 and 1500. We also identify a pulse of human migration between AD 1280 and 1420, shortly preceding the Inka conquest. Looking forward, we expect to converge with ongoing efforts in South America to build a continental research framework to track the movement of people, animals, and artifacts across space and time.},

With advances in microscopic imaging techniques and machine learning computer data analysis methods the relevancy of decontextualized, comingled remains has room for improvement. This thesis is a study done to pioneer a new approach to analyzing dental skeletal remains to determine forensic relevancy.

Archaeological dental samples collected from the ancient city of Ur in modern day southern Iraq in addition to modern dental extractions were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging. Archaeological and modern samples displayed different surface and dentinal tubule opening characteristics. The image files were then analyzed using a custom-built convolutional neural net model. The model’s performance metrics indicate that the model made better than random predictions based on learned associations. Thus, the use of scanning electron microscopy and machine learning analysis techniques has potential in distinguishing archaeological dental samples from modern dental samples.},

WODAN2.0 is developed to rapidly and systematically map archaeology in large and complex datasets. To investigate its practical value, a large, random test dataset-next to a small, non-random dataset-was developed, which better represents the real-world situation of scarce archaeological objects in different types of complex terrain. To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70\% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50\% for barrows, circa 46\% for Celtic fields, and circa 18\% for charcoal kilns. The results show that the introduction of Location-Based Ranking and bagging leads to an improvement in performance varying between 17\% and 35\%. However, WODAN2.0 does not reach or exceed general human performance, when compared to the results of a citizen science project conducted in the same research area.},

	abstract = {Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.},

	abstract = {Cost-effective techniques for systematic archaeological prospection are essential to improve the efficiency of preventive archaeology and the preservation of cultural heritage. Web Mapping Services, such as Microsoft Bing Maps, provide imagery covering extensive areas at high resolution. These can, in some cases, reveal cropmarks of buried historical structures. Given that archaeological prospection is not generally the priority of most common Web Mapping Services, the conditions under which images are acquired are not always suitable for the appearance of cropmarks. Therefore, their detection is typically serendipitous. This pilot project attempts to assess the potential to use the Microsoft Bing Maps Bird's Eye service within a crowdsourcing platform to systematically search for archaeological cropmarks in the surroundings of the city of Rome in Italy. On this platform, which is hosted by the company Scifabric (Southampton, UK) and based on PyBossa, an Open Source framework for crowdsourcing, members of the public are invited to interpret oblique air photo tiles of Bing Maps Bird's Eye. While the project is still on-going, at least one seamless coverage of tiles in the area of interest has been interpreted. For each tile, the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service provides oblique air photo coverage in up to four possible orientations. As of 5 July 2020, 18,765 of the total 67,014 tasks have been completed. Amongst these completed tasks, positive detections of cropmarks were recorded once for 1447 tasks, twice for 57 tasks, and three or more times for 10 tasks. While many of these detections may be erroneous, some correspond with archaeological cropmarks of buried remains of buildings, roads, aqueducts, and urban areas from the Roman period, as verified by comparison with archaeological survey data. This leads to the conclusion that the Bing Maps Bird's Eye service contains a wealth of information useful for archaeological prospection, and that to a certain extent citizen researchers could help to mine this information. However, a more thorough analysis would need to be carried out on possible false negatives and biases related to the varying ease of interpretation of residues of different archaeological structures from multiple historical periods. This activity forms the first part of a research project on the systematic prospection of archaeological cropmarks. The ultimate aim is to reach a critical mass of training data through crowdsourcing which can be augmented and used as input to train a machine learning algorithm for automatic detection on a larger scale.},

These machine learning models are built by placing domestic municipal solid waste quantities together with demographic and socio-economic variables of 200 regions around the area of Akola city, Maharashtra. We are using four machine learning algorithms viz., decision tree, multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost regression algorithms to build predictive models. We needed the data on solid waste generated in those regions and it has been collected from local authorities and the website of Akola Municipal Corporation. From Indian Census and local authorities, we got data for demographic and socio-economic variables. The data pre-processing required in the initial stages of the model building was performed in Python and Microsoft Excel. After this, the models were built with machine learning algorithms and the results of this study showed that these algorithms can be used to estimate solid waste generated in the areas depending on the variables with a good prediction performance. The random forest regression model has the best performance, describing the minimum difference between actual and predicted values of solid waste generated. In this study, we have following the approach where we demonstrate the feasibility of building machine learning models that help in regional waste planning using data collection, data cleaning, data pre-processing, and modelling of available data.},

There are different ways to do it including measuring geometric parallaxes, and via spectroscopy, where absolute magnitudes are recovered through comparison to stellar population models that are primarily dependent on metallicity, i.e. the chemical composition. Spectroscopy is expensive and time-consuming to obtain, but with multi-band photometry it is possible to cover the whole spectrum for a huge number of stars in a small number of exposures, and this amount of data naturally leads to machine learning. We create a neural network using a simplified programming language called fast.ai and Python module PyTorch, in order to recover metallicity from multi-band photometry, and optimize it until it reaches a precision of ó = 0.14dex. We then use this net to get metallicity estimates for more than 18 million stars and generate maps of the Milky Way to compare our results to other works. Once our results satisfactory, we try to create an autoencoder based on the same data used for our previous network, which would work with less complete photometry.},

	abstract = {The increasing role of machine learning in the construction of cultural heritage and humanities datasets necessitates critical examination of the myriad biases introduced by machines, algorithms, and the humans who build and deploy them. From image classification to OCR, the effects of decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts through the search and discovery process. Here, I consider the Library of Congress’s Newspaper Navigator dataset, which I created as part of the Library of Congress’s Innovator-in-Residence program. The dataset consists of visual content extracted from 16 million historic newspaper pages in the Chronicling America database using machine learning. In this data archaeology, I examine the ways in which a Chronicling America newspaper page is transmuted and decontextualized during its journey from a physical artifact to a series of probabilistic photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, cartoons, headlines, and advertisements in the Newspaper Navigator dataset. I consider the digitization journeys of four different pages in Black newspapers in Chronicling America that reproduce the same photograph of W.E.B. Du Bois. In tracing the pages’ journeys, I unpack how each step in the pipelines, such as the imaging process and the construction of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset but also propagates the bias via the machine learning algorithms employed. I investigate the limitations of the Newspaper Navigator dataset and machine learning as it relates to cultural heritage, from marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias to unfair labor practices in the construction of commonly-used datasets. I argue that any use of machine learning with cultural heritage must be done with an understanding of the broader socio-technical ecosystems in which the algorithms have been utilized.},

Traditionally, this challenge has been met by combining the collection of remote sensing data with extensive field work, and the manual interpretation and processing of the combined data. Consequently, this task is a significant logistical undertaking which benefits the production of high quality output, but which is extremely expensive to deliver. Therefore, novel approaches that can automate feature extraction and classification from remotely sensed data, are of great potential interest to NMAs across the entire sector. Using research undertaken at Great Britain’s NMA; Ordnance Survey (OS) as an example, this paper provides an overview of the recent advances at an NMA in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based applications. Examples of these approaches are in automating the process of feature extraction and classification from remotely sensed aerial imagery. In addition, recent OS research in applying deep (convolutional) neural network architectures to image classification are also described. This overview is intended to be useful to other NMAs who may be considering the adoption of similar approaches within their workflows.},

Their distribution and dispersal patterns are key to our understanding of the habitation patterns of our ancestors. Due to the nature of these structures and the construction materials used, centuries of abandonment means that they often go unnoticed at ground level, while being easily identified from an aerial perspective. The increased requirements of land use for the development of urban areas, infrastructure and increased industrialised farming practices means that these monuments are under threat. Recent developments in the field of machine learning coupled with access to hi-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Open Data sources, presents the opportunity to investigate the development of a system for the automated detection of these features.

	abstract = {Entering development in the industrial era 4.0 and during the pandemic caused by Covid 19, a smooth and sustainable business activity will continuously maintain and increase economic growth so that the welfare of people's lives will be guaranteed. One of the means to make and guarantee a smooth and sustainable business is by using digital marketing technology by utilizing WhatsApp messenger services. Companies in this businessman or entrepreneur usually do not have time to serve many customers, especially in the form of online services. A tool is needed to assist the company and a businessman or entrepreneur in answering and introducing new products and services to every customer.. This paper explains how to use an autoresponder as a robot to create an automatic message service on WhatsApp so that customers feel cared for and served and will ultimately feel satisfied. The autoresponder will be runing on the artificial intelligence ​​Conversation Platform model, sending information to customers in the form of text messages that have been stored in the database via a telephone number connected to the internet and also the WhatsApp service center. This method keeps the relationship between the company and the customer intact so that the business can go according to plan and without harming both parties in the transaction.},

Usually, this problem is addressed by discovering natural groups in data measured with spectroscopic techniques. Then, principal component and classical partitioning cluster analysis are employed to reveal the groups that supposedly define the origin of the investigated artefacts. However, this work shows that maximizing the variance and searching for specific cluster structures can be misleading because it fails to discriminate clearly the different archeological sources. In contrast, the new methodology reveals several acknowledged geological sources present in the materials through the exploitation of emergence and swarm intelligence without prior assumptions about the data structures. A combination of unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning and chemometric is applied on samples of Mesoamerican geological sources and obsidian artefacts collected from the archaeological site of Xalasco in Mexico. The analysis of the artifacts showed a preference of Xalasco inhabitants to local obsidian deposits. The results show that this approach, in terms of robustness, is suitable for handling unbiased quantitative spectral analysis of archaeological materials revealing the natural groups of archeological data.},

Recent progress in optical 3D measurements allowed to substitute manual facial reconstruction techniques with computer-aided ones based on digital skull 3D models. Growing amount of data and developing methods for data processing provide a background for creating fully automated technique of face approximation.The performed study addressed to a problem of facial approximation based on skull digital 3D model with deep learning techniques. The skull 3D models used for appearance reconstruction are generated by the original photogrammetric system in automated mode. These 3D models are then used as input for the algorithm for face appearance reconstruction. The paper presents a deep learning approach for facial approximation basing on a skull. It exploits the generative adversarial learning for transition data from one modality (skull) to another modality (face) using digital skull 3D models and face 3D models. A special dataset containing skull 3D models and face 3D models has been collected and adapted for convolutional neural network training and testing. Evaluation results on testing part of the dataset demonstrates high potential of the developed approach in facial approximation.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is an important environmental risk factor in propagation diseases such as lung cancer, autism, asthma and low birth weight etc. Regulation of air quality is an important task of the government in developing countries for ensuring people’s health and welfare. Air pollution differs from place to place and depends on multiple pollutant sources such as industrial emissions, heavy traffic congestions, temperature, pressure, wind, humidity and burning of fossil fuels etc. Analyzing and protecting air quality has become one of the most required activities for the government in almost all the industrial and urban areas today. In this paper, machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the concentrations of air pollutants such as SO2, NOx, PM2.5, O3 and PM10. This paper analyses the air quality based on various pollutant concentrations through visualizations during pre-covid and post-covid days for effective feature extraction and decision making. A machine learning model is built using logistic regression and decision trees to predict the air quality index based on past air quality data. The experimental results show that the proposed model can be efficiently used to detect the quality of air and predictthe level of pollutants in the future.},

When observed keenly, it is often seen that the future behaviour of a person can depend on various factors of the present situation as well as the behaviour in past situations. This research constitutes the prediction of customer churn, i.e. whether the customer will terminate purchasing from the buyer or not, which depends on various factors. We have worked on two types of customer data. First, that is dependent on the present factors which do not affect the past or future purchases. Second, a time series data which gives us an idea of how the future purchases can be related to the purchases in the past. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Artificial neural network, and Recurrent Neural Network has been implemented to discover the correlations of the churn with various factors and classify the customer churn efficiently. The comparison of algorithms indicates that the results of Logistic Regression were slightly better for the first Dataset. The Recurrent Neural Network model, which was applied to the time-series dataset, also gave better results.},

	abstract = {Eastern Africa is a key region for studying archaeological, palaeontological, and ecological movements. This region hosts critical developments in hominin and human evolution, the dispersal of food-producing populations across the continent, and some of the largest known contemporary mammalian migrations on the planet. Strontium isotope analysis of biominerals such as tooth enamel, eggshell, and other tissues in modern animals have been used to reconstruct migration, residential mobility, and provenience. The diverse geologies of Kenya and Tanzania, ranging from the Archaean Basement System rocks of the Tanzania Craton to the recent volcanics of rift valleys, make it a highly promising area for mobility and provenience studies using strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86). Nevertheless, the application of strontium isotope analysis to reconstruct migration and individual mobility has been limited in the region due to the lack of a map predicting biologically available (bioavailable) Sr-87/Sr-86. We present bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from a variety of modern and archaeological materials throughout Kenya and northern Tanzania. We show that Sr-87/Sr-86 of living organisms in the study area range from as low as 0.70439 for samples collected from Neogene volcanics to 0.72796 for samples collected from Precambrian Basement System rocks. We also present an Sr-87/Sr-86 map (isoscape) of Kenya and Tanzania developed using a machine-learning framework and a compilation of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 data from Africa. This map provides the first predictions of bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 for East Africa, and represents a crucial resource for future work on ancient and modern animal and human mobility.},

	abstract = {A number of shipwreck archaeological sites worldwide have underlined the importance of shipwreck localization and detection. Accidents that led to sinking are one of the possible causes of those shipwrecks. The shipwreck of MV Bahuga Jaya, which is located in the Sunda Strait, Indonesia could be such an example. A multibeam swath survey is a suitable technique to map the wreck location since it can produce high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and backscatter imagery. Both the analysis of the bathymetry DEM and backscatter use visual examination. However, morphometric analysis of the DEM and texture analysis of the backscatter, subsequently combined with the machine learning classification, could give a preferable result in shipwreck detection and monitoring. In this paper, slope analysis of DEM bathymetry and texture analysis of multibeam backscatter imagery are presented. Those first-order textural features are used to carry out a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to separate between the wreck and non-wreck objects. A combination of SVM classification and slope analysis is investigated to detect the wreck location. Following that, K-means clustering is also performed to obtain the seabed characterization. Results indicate that the combination of machine learning and morphometric analysis can give a promising outcome in shipwreck detection. In addition, the result of K-means clustering reveals that soft seabed is more dominant than the hard seabed in the study area with 56.4\% and 43.6\% respectively. This study could play a role as a complementary tool to monitor and manage the shipwreck archaeological site location.},

The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between the field of machine learning pursued by computer scientists and the types of on-the-ground projects of interest to earth scientists and others who seek to improve management and conservation practices. This project began in 2018 with the goal of creating a targeted method of finding cave entrances in the dense tropical forest of Guatemala and Belize. In 2019, we used a random forest classifier, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, and a training dataset of known caves to successfully identify several previously undocumented caves in northwestern Belize. Building on this work, modeling has been expanded to include other types of hidden and obscured features that colleagues are interested in studying. These include ancient Maya archaeological features in Guatemala and Mexico and shipwrecks off the coast of the United States. The models for the archaeological features are based on existing convolutional neural network architectures and make use of transfer learning. The Maya archaeological feature model uses ALS data as input. The shipwreck model, which is being completed under the aegis of the Navy's Underwater Archaeology Branch (UA), is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data available from NOAA's Data Access Viewer and NOAA's Wrecks and Obstructions Database, as well as UA's records. These models can be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Such models can easily be adjusted to identify other types of features, even using multispectral or RGB imagery as input. This work seeks to make machine learning methods accessible to non-computer scientists interested in study, management, and/or conservation of the landscape.},

We describe the ways in which benchmark datasets in machine learning operate as infrastructure and pose four research questions for these datasets.

Archaeological data are crucial for understanding the past, and as such, documentation of this information is imperative. The development of machine intelligence approaches (including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other automated processes) has resulted in massive gains in archaeological knowledge, as such computational methods have expedited the rate of archaeological survey and discovery via remote sensing instruments. Nevertheless, the progression of automated computational approaches is limited by distinct geographic imbalances in where these techniques are developed and applied. Here, I investigate the degree of this disparity and some potential reasons for this imbalance. Analyses from Web of Science and Microsoft Academic searches reveal that there is a substantial difference between the Global North and South in the output of machine intelligence remote sensing archaeology literature. There are also regional imbalances. I argue that one solution is to increase collaborations between research institutions in addition to data sharing efforts.},

Archaeology has long struggled with establishing consistent characterizations of the phenomena it studies. As such, I argue that the procedures used for automated methods are useful for archaeologists – even outside of automated analyses – by allowing for the creation of consistent definitions which permit for reproducible research designs.},

	abstract = {Faunal remains recovered at early archaeological sites dated to around 2 million years (Ma) play a critical role in discussions about the evolution of early hominin behavior. Anthropogenic assemblages from this time period are scarce, however and, until recently, most of the available evidence on the behavior of early Homo has been almost exclusively obtained at the FLK Zinj site from Bed I in Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania). The recent discovery of DS (David’s Site, 1.84 Ma) and two additional hominin-made accumulations on the same paleosurface as the iconic site of FLK Zinj provides an invaluable opportunity to address key issues regarding early hominin lifestyles, particularly their subsistence behaviors and their foraging capabilities. The DS site has been extensively excavated and is exceptionally well preserved. Over the past years, significant advances in taphonomic and spatial statistical techniques have been made, which mainly involve the combination of several variables in multivariate approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms. The application of these methods to the faunal fossil record within extended frames of reference helps overcome equifinality when trying to detect the main agent of site formation and interpret site function...},

To promote sustainability, smart production requires global perspectives of smart production application technology. In this regard, thanks to intensive research efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a number of AI-based techniques, such as machine learning, have already been established in the industry to achieve sustainable manufacturing. Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now. Eighty-two articles were reviewed and classified. A first interesting result is the greater number of works published by the USA and the increasing interest after the birth of Industry 4.0.},

	abstract = {Moroccan craftsmanship has been booming in recent years. The decorations mark refined traces of patterns and forms rich in colors. Despite recent studies, the machine still finds problems recognizing patterns and shapes. In this paper, we propose a new method of classifying decor patterns based on the analysis of the texture and color of the images. Texture information describes the cross section of the pattern while color describes the distribution of colors in the image. In the majority of cases, the Moroccan decoration is composed of five basic elements: ceramic, plaster, fabric, glass, and wood. In a first step, we based ourselves on the techniques of extraction of the characteristics of texture and color. The techniques we used for the description of the images are the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) combined with the Color Histogram (CH). In a second step, we proposed a machine learning classification model based on K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results obtained for the classification of set images exceed an accuracy of 86\%.},

From the results, it was observed that 73\% of the visitors to the site are non-Mexicans. Meanwhile, 14.4\% of the box office tickets are for national adults, divided between tickets sold during weekdays and tickets given on Sundays which are free for all nationals. The remaining 12.6\% corresponds to tickets divided onto 11 different categories according to the current federal law. Different visitoŕs behaviours were observed such as arrival times, season arrivals, and arrival time span. The results will allow for identifying strengths, weakness of the activities as well as possible threats.

The study of the bacterial DNA extracted from human bones excavated from archaeological and anthropological sites aims to analyse the evolution of microorganisms inhabiting the human body and to contribute to new insight related to the health, diet and even migration of our ancestors. This paper aims to offer a solution for the discrimination between ancient and modern bacterial DNA in dental calculus. We propose three internal representations for the considered DNA sequences in order to analyse which captures the most information and is more informative for classification models. Two of these are text-based, while the third one takes advantage of several physical and chemical properties of nucleotides in the DNA. We use a data set containing both ancient and modern dental calculus bacterial DNA and apply two supervised models, namely artificial neural networks and support vector machines to distinguish between the two types of sequences. The two main conclusions indicated by the obtained results are: the representation based on physical and chemical properties seems to best capture relevant information for the task at hand; for the considered data set and DNA encoding proposals, support vector machines outperform artificial neural networks, although results obtained by both models are promising.},

While challenges involved in spatially correcting these unusual panoramic film images has long served as a stumbling block to researchers, an online tool called "Sunspot" now offers a straightforward process for efficient and accurate orthorectification of CORONA, helping to unlock the potential of this historical imagery for global-scale archaeological prospection. With these new opportunities come significant new challenges in how best to search through large imagery datasets like that offered by CORONA. In contrast to currently popular trends in archaeological remote sensing that seek to employ either automated, machine learning-based approaches, or alternatively, crowd-sourced approaches to assist in the identification of ancient sites and features, this paper argues for systematic, intensive, and expert-led "brute force" methods. Results from a project that has sought to map all sites and related features across a large study in the northern Fertile Crescent illustrate how an expert-led analysis may be the best means of generating nuanced, contextual understandings of complex archaeological landscapes.},

To guide this search task, NER is needed. We created rigorous annotation guidelines in an iterative process, then instructed five archaeology students to annotate a number of documents. The resulting dataset contains similar to 31k annotations between six entity types (artefact, time period, place, context, species \& material). The inter-annotator agreement is 0.95, and when we used this data for machine learning, we observed an increase in F1 score from 0.51 to 0.70 in comparison to a machine learning model trained on a dataset created in prior work. This indicates that the data is of high quality, and can confidently be used to train NER classifiers.},

	abstract = {The traditional pottery industry was an important activity in Catalonia (NE Spain) up to the 20th century. However, nowadays only few workshops persist in small villages were the activity is promoted as a touristic attraction. The preservation and promotion of traditional pottery in Catalonia is part of an ongoing strategy of tourism diversification that is revitalizing the sector. The production of authenticable local pottery handicrafts aims at attracting cultivated and high-purchasing power tourists. The present paper inspects several approaches to set up a scientific protocol based on the chemical composition of both raw materials and pottery. These could be used to develop a seal of quality and provenance to regulate the sector. Six Catalan villages with a renowned tradition of local pottery production have been selected. The chemical composition of their clays and the corresponding fired products has been obtained by Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). Using the obtained geochemical dataset, a number of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods have been applied to test their applicability to define geochemical fingerprints that could allow inter-site discrimination. The unsupervised approach fails to distinguish samples from different provenances. These methods are only roughly able to divide the different provenances in two large groups defined by their different SiO2 and CaCO3 concentrations. In contrast, almost all the tested supervised methods allow inter-site discrimination with accuracy levels above 80\%, and accuracies above 85\% were obtained using a meta-model combining all the predictive supervised methods. The obtained results can be taken as encouraging and demonstrative of the potential of the supervised approach as a way to define geochemical fingerprints to track or attest the provenance of samples.},

	abstract = {In the Age of Empires of the first millennium BCE when large, major urban centres dominated the plains of Mesopotamia and the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, the rural
landscape began to transform, with settlements often located away from traditional, mounded
sites. Finding these sites can be challenging but is not impossible. However, the mountainous
regions in Iraq and the neighbouring areas present special methodological challenges. Many
sites occupied were flat and low, making them less visible in surveys and even in satellitebased remote sensing data. Machine-learning techniques and the use of point pattern analysis
of stone debris offer the possibility of finding the typically less detectable flat sites using
drone (UAV) imagery. Once detected, flat sites offer the considerable advantage that street
networks and urban zones can be more easily mapped by using geophysical prospection. This
provides advantages in understanding movement within such sites using graph analysis and
can help provide insight into social behaviour in the use of urban zones and land use more
easily than Bronze Age mounded sites. This paper explores both these issues and discusses
their usefulness in Iraqi Kurdistan and beyond.},

Environmental big data is a kind of new method and thought, which brings both  opportunities and challenges to GIS-based spatial analysis in geochemical  studies. However, big data research in environmental geochemistry is still in its  preliminary stage, and what practical problems can be solved still remain  unclear. This short review paper briefly discusses the main problems and  solutions of spatial analysis related to the big data in environmental  geochemistry, with a focus on the development and applications of conventional  GIS-based approaches as well as advanced spatial machine learning techniques. The  topics discussed include probability distribution and data transformation,  spatial structures and patterns, correlation and spatial relationships, data  visualisation, spatial prediction, background and threshold, hot spots and  spatial outliers as well as distinction of natural and anthropogenic factors. It  is highlighted that the integration of spatial analysis on the GIS platform  provides effective solutions to revealing the hidden spatial patterns and  spatially varying relationships in environmental geochemistry, demonstrated by an  example of cadmium concentrations in the topsoil of Northern Ireland through hot  spot analysis. In the big data era, further studies should be more inclined to  the integration and application of spatial machine learning techniques, as well  as investigation on the temporal trends of environmental geochemical features.},

During the archeological excavations, 14 inhumation pits with the human remains of 21 individuals were found at the site. The subsequent identification process was carried out, including the analysis and cross-comparison of post-mortem data obtained in situ and in the lab with ante-mortem data obtained from historical archives. In parallel, three anthropologists with diverse backgrounds in craniofacial identification and two students without previous experience attempted to identify 11 of these 21 individuals using the craniofacial superimposition technique. To do this, the five participants had access to 18 3D scanned skulls and 14 photographs of 11 different candidates. The participants faced a cross-comparison problem involving 252 skull-face overlay scenarios. The methodology follows the main agreements of the European project MEPROCS and uses the software Skeleton-ID (TM). Based on MEPROCS standard, a final decision was provided within a scale, assigning a value in terms of strong, moderate, or limited support to the claim that the skull and the facial image belonged (or not) to the same person for each case. The problem of binary classification, positive/negative, with an identification rate for each participant was revealed. The results obtained in this study make the authors think that both the quality of the materials used and the previous experience of the analyst play a fundamental role when reaching conclusions using the CFS technique.},

Archaeologists use insights from the experimental replication of lithics to understand phenomena such as the behaviours and cognitive capacities required to manufacture them. However, such experiments can require large amounts of time and raw materials, and achieving sufficient control of key variables can be difficult. A computer program able to accurately simulate stone tool production would make lithic experimentation faster, more accessible, reproducible, less biased, and may lead to reliable insights into the factors that structure the archaeological record. We present here a proof of concept for a machine learning-based virtual knapping framework capable of quickly and accurately predicting flake removals from 3D cores using a conditional adversarial neural network (CGAN). We programmatically generated a testing dataset of standardised 3D cores with flakes knapped from them. After training, the CGAN accurately predicted the length, volume, width, and shape of these flake removals using the intact core surface information alone. This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning for investigating lithic production virtually. With a larger training sample and validation against archaeological data, virtual knapping could enable fast, cheap, and highly-reproducible virtual lithic experimentation.},

Currently available repellents for personal or household protection are limited in their efficacy, applicability, and safety profile.

To achieve this, we digitized a large, historic dataset containing ∼19,000 mosquito repellency measurements. We then trained a graph neural network (GNN) to map molecular structure and repellency. We applied this model to select 317 candidate molecules to test in parallelizable behavioral assays, quantifying repellency in multiple pest species and in follow-up trials with human volunteers. The GNN approach outperformed a chemoinformatic model and produced a hit rate that increased with training data size, suggesting that both model innovation and novel data collection were integral to predictive accuracy. We identified {\textgreater}10 molecules with repellency similar to or greater than the most widely used repellents. This approach enables computational screening of billions of possible molecules to identify empirically tractable numbers of candidate repellents, leading to accelerated progress towards solving a global health challenge.},

	abstract = {The remains of archaeological and historical sites exist all over the world, and their existence provides the basis of research for many disciplines such as Archaeology, History, and Geography. The distribution of such sites is non-random since human behaviors are controlled by environmental conditions. People in the past depended much more on the natural environment than today because of the lack of advanced technology to cope with nature. Therefore, exploring the relationship between the locations of archaeological sites and surrounding environments is useful to understand why and how past people selected the location of sites. This research establishes a predictive model to determine factors affecting the distribution of the archaeological/historical sites in Japan and China and rank them according to the degree of relevance. Special attention is paid to the influence of topographic factors. The DEMs used for this study reflect the human transformation of land due to the construction of the archaeological/historical sites. To consider the geomorphological environment when the site location was selected, we vectorized the outline of each site, and data only outside of the polygon were used for analysis. Then the topographic condition around each archaeological site was evaluated based on buffer-ring analysis and zonal statistics. The results allowed us to construct a predictive model for the spatial distribution of the sites based on topographic conditions. The model utilizes the Attentional Factorization Machines (AFM) for pairwise factors exploration. Among the sites, 75\% were used for model training, and 25\% were used for performance tests. The resultant multivariate model suggests that topography and related hydrological conditions affected the site distribution, which is helpful to understand the interaction between ancient people and the environment.},

	abstract = {Stone walls in the landscape of Denmark are protected not only for their cultural and historical significance but also for their vital role in supporting local biodiversity. Many stone wall structures have either disappeared, suffered substantial damage, or had segments removed. Additionally, as it stands today, the registry of these structures, managed by each municipality, is outdated and incomplete. Leveraging recent developments in Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we analyze the publicly available terrain data (40 cm resolution) derived from the Danish LiDAR data, using a U-Net-like CNN model to assess the stone walls dataset and provide for an update of the registry. While the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) alone provided good results, better results were obtained when adding Height Above Terrain (HAT) and an additional DTM layer with a Sobel filter applied. Using a pixel-wise evaluation, there was an overall agreement of 93\% between ground truth and prediction of stone walls in a validation area and 88\% overall agreement for the whole predicted area. Good generalizability was found when externally validating the model on new data, showing positive results for both the existing stone walls and predicting new potential ones upon visualisation. The method performed best in open areas, however positive results were also seen in forested areas, although denser areas and urban areas presented as challenging. Given the lack of a reference dataset or other studies on this specific matter, the evaluation of our study was heavily based on the stone walls registry itself complemented by visual inspection of the predictions and on the ground in the Danish municipality of ae ro. Automating the process of identifying and updating the stone walls registry in Denmark is of great relevance to the local governments. We suggest the development of a Decision Support System to allow municipalities access to the results of this method.},

To this end, we explore the machine learning problem of instance classification for large archaeological images datasets, i.e. where each individual object (instance) is itself a class that all of the multiple images of that object belongs. We focus on a wide variety of objects in the Durham Oriental Museum with which we build a dataset with over 24,502 images of 4,332 unique object instances. We experiment with state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models, the smaller variations of which are suitable for deployment on mobile applications. We find the exact object instance of a given image can be predicted from among 4,332 others with ∼72\% accuracy, showing how effectively machine learning can detect a known object from a new image. We demonstrate that accuracy significantly improves as the number of images-per-object instance increases (up to ∼83\%), with an ensemble of classifiers scoring as high as 84\%. We find that the correct instance is found in the top 3, 5, or 10 predictions of our best models ∼91\%, ∼93\%, or ∼95\% of the time respectively. Our findings contribute to the emerging overlap of machine learning and cultural heritage, and highlights the potential available to future applications and research.},

We provide asteroseismic radius and mass coefficients, κR and κM, for ∼19,000 red giant stars, which translate directly to radius and mass given a temperature. As such, K2 GAP DR3 represents the largest asteroseismic sample in the literature to date. K2 GAP DR3 stellar parameters are calibrated to be on an absolute parallactic scale based on Gaia DR2, with red giant branch and red clump evolutionary state classifications provided via a machine-learning approach. Combining these stellar parameters with GALAH DR3 spectroscopy, we determine asteroseismic ages with precisions of ∼20\%–30\% and compare age-abundance relations to Galactic chemical evolution models among both low- and high-α populations for α, light, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We confirm recent indications in the literature of both increased Ba production at late Galactic times as well as significant contributions to r-process enrichment from prompt sources associated with, e.g., core-collapse supernovae. With an eye toward other Galactic archeology applications, we characterize K2 GAP DR3 uncertainties and completeness using injection tests, suggesting that K2 GAP DR3 is largely unbiased in mass/age, with uncertainties of 2.9\% (stat.) ± 0.1\% (syst.) and 6.7\% (stat.) ± 0.3\% (syst.) in κR and κM for red giant branch stars and 4.7\% (stat.) ± 0.3\% (syst.) and 11\% (stat.) ± 0.9\% (syst.) for red clump stars. We also identify percent-level asteroseismic systematics, which are likely related to the time baseline of the underlying data, and which therefore should be considered in TESS asteroseismic analysis.},

We train the network on the target galaxy’s own local environment defined by the stellar halo and the surviving satellites. We demonstrate that this approach allows the detection of accreted stars that are spatially mixed into the disc. Two performance measures are defined – recovery fraction of accreted stars, frecov and the probability that a star with a positive (accreted) classification is a true-positive result, P(TP). As the NNM output is akin to an assigned probability (Pa), we are able to determine positivity based on flexible threshold values that can be adjusted easily to refine the selection of presumed-accreted stars. We find that  gann identifies accreted disc stars within simulated galaxies, with high frecov and/or high P(TP). We also find that stars in Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage (GES) mass systems are over 50 per cent recovered by our NNMs in the majority (18/24) of cases. Additionally, nearly every individual source of accreted stars is detected at 10 per cent or more of its peak stellar mass in the disc. We also demonstrate that a conglomerated NNM, trained on the halo and satellite stars from all of the Auriga galaxies provides the most consistent results, and could prove to be an intriguing future approach as our observational capabilities expand.},

The standard investigation makes use of a combination of invasive and non-invasive techniques and complex devices, while it also relies on the extensive experience of the restorer. The current paper puts forward a new possibility of employing an alternative computational solution with the support of deep learning that recognizes and delineates all the corrosive compounds from stereo microscope images of the surface of a metal item. With the input received from a portable microscope, such a fast non-destructive tool would provide straightforward assistance at the excavation site, as well as a second opinion for novice investigators. Iron archaeological objects are considered and four corrosion compounds are identified and outlined by the deep learning models, i.e. Fe2O3, FeSO4, FeCl3 and FeO. The results show that the deep computational identification and delimitation of the four corrosive types is meticulous even with a minimal annotation provided for training.},

Existing methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology -- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest. Our method is on par with far more sophisticated mitigation methods across different tasks: identifying and correcting mislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples, prioritizing points relevant for training and enabling scalable human auditing of relevant examples.},

The improvements in prediction accuracy reported in previous studies are usually limited to a single area. We performed a meta-analysis of regional satellite-based soil salinity predictions combined with in situ soil sampling and machine learning. Based on R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) collected, we evaluated the effects of various features on the model accuracy and established a Bayesian network to evaluate the joint causal effect of multifeatures. Most significant differences were found in soil sampling schemes and characteristics of the study area, including the mean and variability (averaged R2 of 0.75 for soil sample sets with lower salinity variation and 0.62 for others) of the salinity, climate type ( R2 of 0.64 in arid areas and 0.74 in others), soil texture ( R2 of 0.66 in sandy areas and 0.57 in others), and the interval between sampling date and satellite data acquisition date ( R2 of 0.53 under the condition of over 15 days and 0.65 in others). Generally, using different satellite data has limited effects on model performance among which Sentinel-2 performed better ( R2 = 0.72) than Landsat ( R2 = 0.66). The sampling of subsamples for each sample should focus on their subpixel-scale spatial heterogeneity across satellite data rather than the number of subsamples.

	abstract = {The field of citizen science involves the participation of citizens across different stages of a scientific project; within this field there is currently a rapid expansion of the integration of humans and AI computational technologies based on machine learning and/or neural networking-based paradigms. The distribution of tasks between citizens (“the crowd”), experts, and this type of technologies has received relatively little attention. To illustrate the current state of task allocation in citizen science projects that integrate humans and computational technologies, an integrative literature review of 50 peer-reviewed papers was conducted. A framework was used for characterizing citizen science projects based on two main dimensions: (a) the nature of the task outsourced to the crowd, and (b) the skills required by the crowd to perform a task. The framework was extended to include tasks performed by experts and AI computational technologies as well. Most of the tasks citizens do in the reported projects are well-structured, involve little interdependence, and require skills prevalent among the general population. The work of experts is typically structured and at a higher-level of interdependence than that of citizens, requiring expertize in specific fields. Unsurprisingly, AI computational technologies are capable of performing mostly well-structured tasks at a high-level of interdependence. It is argued that the distribution of tasks that results from the combination of computation and citizen science may disincentivize certain volunteer groups. Assigning tasks in a meaningful way to citizen scientists alongside experts and AI computational technologies is an unavoidable design challenge.},

	abstract = {Unlike large cities and urban heritage attractions, archaeological heritage sites in peripheral locations cannot readily absorb the impact of over-tourism. Peru's rapid growth as a tourist destination since the late 1990s has been bolstered by the popularity of its archaeological heritage sites and past civilizations, particularly in the Cuzco region. As mass tourism and issues of overcrowding have confronted visitors and heritage managers in the Cuzco region, tourists have sought alternative archaeological attractions beyond Cuzco's ticketed sites - many of which are open-access and unmonitored. By integrating large-scale internet photo datasets from Flickr and the power of computer vision and machine learning algorithms, this study identifies 'on-the-rise' (i.e. emerging) archaeological heritage attractions accessible from five Peruvian cities. The major contributions of this paper are (1) to provide a novel method capable of being scaled globally to identify emerging archaeological tourist attractions that are unmonitored by ticket sales, (2) to identify 'on-the-rise' archaeological attractions in Peru, and (3) to mitigate future risk (e.g. over-tourism, pollution, destruction and damage) at identified sites as tourist itineraries continue to expand. The identification of emerging archaeological heritage attractions is significant for targeted and sustainable heritage planning, archaeological conservation, future destination marketing and tourism development.},

	abstract = {This work extricates the image characteristic features for the classification of archeological monument images. At the pre-processing stage, archeological dataset sample images are treated by using structure safeguarding image abstraction framework, which can deliver the most effective image abstraction output by manipulating the perceptible features in the given low-illuminated and underexposed color image samples. Proposed abstraction-framework effectively boosted the significant image property features like color, edge, sharpness, contrast and suppresses complexity and noise. The image properties were also refined at each phase based on the attained statistical feature disposal information. The work adopted the Harris feature identification technique to identify the most significant image features in the input and enhanced images. The framework also preserves significant features in the foreground of an image by intelligently integrating the series of filters during rigorous experimental work and also diminishes the background content of an input image. The proposed archeological system evaluates every stage of the result with assorted subjective matters and calculates the image quality and properties assessment statistical attributes. By this way prominent features in an image have been recognized. The efficiency of this work has been corroborated by performing the trials on the selected archeological dataset. In addition, user’s visual feedback and the standard image quality assessment techniques were also used to evaluate the proposed pre-processing framework. Based on the obtained abstraction images from the framework, this work extracts the image gray color texture features using GLCM, color texture from CTMs and deep-learning features from AlexNet for the classification of archeological monument classification. This work adopted a support vector machine as a classifier. To corroborate the efficiency of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted on our own data set of Chalukya, Kadamba, Hoysala and new engraving monuments, each domain consisting of 500 archeological data set samples with large intra-class variation, with different environmental lighting condition, low-illumination and different pose. Implementation of this work was carried out in MATLAB-2020 with HPC Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU, and obtained results show that combination of multiple features significantly improves the performance to the extent of 98.10\%.},

	abstract = {Jusepe de Ribera (1591 – 1652) painted the composition Onuphrius the Hermit during the Counter-Reformation period of Naples, when specific religious themes were encouraged and depictions of penitent, suffering saints were regularly produced in Ribera’s workshop [1]. In this painting, Saint Onuphrius is represented with great intensity and extreme realism. The Saint, who chose to live as a hermit in the Egyptian desert, is painted with his hands joined, glancing upwards in prayer. His grey hair and beard, and his emaciated torso reflect his life of struggle and deprivation. Anatomical details are depicted with vibrant brush strokes together with the rendering of intense light, creating an image of reality and extreme spirituality. Multiple versions of this composition exist and a version painted on an oak panel was acquired for the Royal Danish Collection in 1764. When this work was X-radiographed for the first time in 1984, an entirely different composition was discovered below the surface [2]. Turned 90 degrees counter clockwise to a landscape orientation, the underlying composition shows a depiction of the Flight of the Holy Family into Egypt. This first and now hidden composition was likely painted with bright tints of blue, green and red mixed with lead white, while the monochromatic palette of the upper composition mostly contains dense layers of lead white in the figure surrounded by a dark background, which prevent a clear view of the hidden work in the X-radiograph. A clearer understanding and dating of the underlying composition required determination of which pigments comprised the palettes of the surface versus the hidden motif.  Macro-X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) spectroscopy was selected as the key non-invasive analytical technique due to its ability to yield chemical information at the elemental level. Moreover, being a scanning method that produces full chemical distribution images, MA-XRF spectroscopy enabled an optimal understanding of the full suite of pigments across the painting in both compositions. MA-XRF elemental mapping was performed at the Conservation and Art Technological Studies (CATS) laboratory of the National Gallery of Denmark (SMK) using the Bruker CRONO system, which has a motorized stage designed to collect chemical distributions across large painted surfaces.XRF data maps were overlaid onto the X-radiograph and complementary multispectral images to better visualize the hidden painting. A combination of unsupervised machine learning methods based on neural networks [3,4] was used to automatically reduce the XRF spectral imaging data to a set of distinct clusters that share similar spectra, making it possible to identify materials more precisely and deduce the paint sequence. The interpretation was confirmed by additional scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) measurements of paint cross sections. Finally, the chemical characterization of the materials together with iconographic research and dendrochronology helped determine the time of execution and the relation between the two compositions in terms of their period of execution.

The presence of trees and undergrowth makes the reconnaissance of archaeological features and remains very difficult, while the erosion, increased by slope, tends to adversely affect the microtopographical features of potential archaeological interest, thus making them hardly identifiable. For the purpose of our investigations, a UAV LiDAR survey has been carried out at Perticara (located in Basilicata southern Italy), an abandoned medieval village located in a geologically fragile area, characterized by complex topography, strong erosion, and a dense forest cover. All of these characteristics pose serious challenge issues and make this site particularly significant and attractive for the setting and testing of an optimal LiDAR-based approach to analyze hilly forested regions searching for subtle archaeological features. The LiDAR based investigations were based on three steps: (i) field data acquisition and data pre-processing, (ii) data post-processing, and (iii) semi-automatic feature extraction method based on machine learning and local statistics. The results obtained from the LiDAR based analyses successfully confirmed by the field survey) made it possible to identify the lost medieval village that represents an emblematic case of settlement abandoned during the crisis of the late Middle Ages that affected most regions in southern Italy.},

Though the cultural heritage community has collectively developed an emerging body of work detailing responsible operations for machine learning in libraries and other cultural heritage institutions at the organizational level, there remains a paucity of guidelines created specifically for practitioners embarking on machine learning projects. The manifold stakes and sensitivities involved in applying machine learning to cultural heritage underscore the importance of developing such guidelines. This paper contributes to this need by formulating a detailed checklist with guiding questions and practices that can be employed while developing a machine learning project that utilizes cultural heritage data. I call the resulting checklist the "Collections as ML Data" checklist, which, when completed, can be published with the deliverables of the project. By surveying existing projects, including my own project, Newspaper Navigator, I justify the "Collections as ML Data" checklist and demonstrate how the formulated guiding questions can be employed and operationalized.},

Valuable physical and chemical information can be obtained through scientific micro damage analysis of precious pottery, which plays a positive role in the protection of ceramics and archaeological research. In this study, LIBS spectroscopy combined with sequential backward selection-random forest regression (SBS-RFR) algorithm was proposed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multi-elements in ceramic samples. Firstly, the experimental conditions for LIBS spectrum acquisition of ceramic samples were optimized, including delay time, laser pulse energy and cumulative times, and the characteristic emission lines of typical elements in LIBS spectra of ceramic samples were identified based on national institute of standards and technology (NIST) database. Four different spectral preprocessing methods are used to preprocess LIBS spectral data to find a better preprocessing method. And then, SBS algorithm is applied to eliminate irrelevant or redundant feature variables of LIBS spectrum. SBS-RFR calibration model is constructed based on the screened input variables to realize the rapid determination of multi-element content of ceramic samples. To further verify the prediction performance of the SBS-RFR calibration model, its prediction performance is compared with several other models. The results show that SBS-RFR model has better prediction performance than partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest regression (RFR), of which the R-2 values of prediction set are all over or close 0.98, and the RMSE values for Mg, Al, Ca and Fe are 0.3954\%, 0.4627\%, 0.2532\% and 0.3791\% respectively. This study shows that LIBS technology combined with SBS-RFR algorithm is a feasible method for the quantitative analysis of elements in ceramic samples.},

Based on the results, a forecast map of the location of archaeological sites was created. The greatest probability of discovering new archaeological objects could be provided by the following landscape parameters, no further than 500-600 m from the river with a slope steepness of up to 4 degrees, with high intensity and summer ( June) solar radiation and with an exposure of slopes: southern, south-eastern and western. Unexplored archaeological sites in South-East Altai are most likely located along river valleys in the middle and lower reaches, at the confluence of rivers, along the periphery of intermountain basins, or on wide flat areas of above-floodplain terraces of river valleys. The data obtained make it possible to assess the contribution of landscape features to the spatial distribution of religious buildings of ancient peoples and provide opportunities for the search for new archaeological sites.},

	abstract = {Inductive predictive modelling is a controversial tool in archaeology. Visibility, taphonomy and research history can affect the statistical reliability of an archaeological dataset to be used as a training sample for a predictive model. To overcome these biases, an ethnoarchaeological approach has been proposed. This methodology has been developed and tested on a pastoral context in the Eastern Italian Alps. The present research proposes an application to a different, more composite landscape in the Central Italian Alps, testing the reliability of the model in relation to a heterogeneous and diachronic dataset, collected through extensive fieldwork. The results show that the model has an excellent degree of accuracy in predicting past structures with a similar purpose of use as the training sample. In addition, we show that its discriminative power can be greatly improved by the use of contemporary environmental predictors. However, the use of variables non-quantifiable for the past is an issue for the full applicability of this type of model to archaeological datasets. The results also show that this methodology, regardless of predictive results, can give us a good insight into the relationship between humans and their environment. The field application of the methodology has led us to understand that ethnoarchaeology can already be considered a reliable approach to address various methodological concerns of archaeological predictive modelling, but the primary purpose of such models should be seen more as explanatory rather than predictive.},

	abstract = {The integration of AI in archaeology poses several risks due to the oversimplification of complex archaeological data for computational ease. This reductionist approach fosters a deterministic view, treating provisional classifications as definitive truths and influencing subsequent interpretations. The reliance on legacy data and Big Data for AI training risks perpetuating outdated ideas and frameworks. As AI expands from automating tasks to interpreting and creating reconstructions, archaeologists must adopt a critical approach to avoid biased and harmful outputs. The deterministic view of AI hinders informed debate. Archaeologists should engage in discussions that address the classificatory, and ethical aspects as well as the materiality of AI. The accumulation of data in AI mimics storytelling but lacks the interpretative depth needed to understand historical human perspectives. Developing theories and narrative practices is essential to making archaeological data meaningful. The shift from a representational to a co-creative view of data is necessary to understand its re-use and the power dynamics involved. Finally, to normalise AI in archaeology, a critical and sceptical approach is needed to integrate AI into the real world and understand its implications and ethical considerations.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a growing body of literature has emerged which is concerned with the question of what form a promising concept of social resilience might take. In this article we argue that social resilience has the potential to be crafted into a coherent analytic framework that can build on scientific knowledge from the established concept of social vulnerability, and offer a fresh perspective on today’s challenges of global change. Based on a critical review of recently published literature on the issue, we propose to define social resilience as being comprised of three dimensions: 1. Coping capacities –the ability of social actors to cope with and overcome all kinds of adversities; 2. Adaptive capacities – their ability to learn from past experiences and adjust themselves to future challenges in their everyday lives; 3. Transformative capacities – their ability to craft sets of institutions that foster individual welfare and sustainable societal robustness towards future crises. Viewed in this way, the search for ways to build social resilience – especially in the livelihoods of the poor and marginalized – is revealed to be not only a technical, but also a political issue.},

This study presents a novel bibliometric assessment of archaeology's status relative to other fields using a hard/soft framework. It also presents a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Reproducibility is a factor in the hardness/softness of a field because of its importance in establishing consensus. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A survey of reproducibility reviews for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology's scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.},

One-sample tests that compare a site sample against a background standard are conceptually and statistically superior, but have been difficult to implement for continuous data types. This situation now is changed owing to a relatively new computer technology known as Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS can provide a complete description of the nature of the background environment of entire regions for categorical and continuous data types, thereby allowing the ready application of one-sample testing strategies. Examples of several GIS-based one-sample tests are given using data from east-central Arizona. Such conventional tests only should be applied, however, when the observations can be shown to be statistically independent through tests for spatial autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {AbstractBackgroundReporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy‐to‐use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams.Methods and FindingsWe developed a free‐to‐use, Open Source R package and web‐based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web‐based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/.ConclusionsWe have developed a user‐friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020‐compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/). This free‐to‐use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

However, they have been using high-resolution DEMs primarily for visual interpretation and expert-judgement classification of landform. OBIA can perform these classifications much faster and in a more objective fashion. The method was tested on a study area in the south east of the Netherlands. It is concluded that OBIA is a suitable technique for quick and objective delineation of landform, but needs an improved conceptual framework adapted to the local situation and archaeological questions to better identify and interpret the derived landform objects.},

The ways in which GIS can most usefully facilitate archaeological analysis and interpretation are then explored particularly as a tool for the management of archaeological resources. Formal analysis of archaeological material, and the use of trend surface, contouring and interpolation procedures are considered along with predictive modeling analysis of visibility and intervisibility. Finally there is a discussion of leading-edge issues, including three-dimensional GIS, object-oriented GIS, the relationship between GIS and 'Virtual Reality' technologies, and the integration of GIS with distributed systems and the Internet.The approach is light, and technical detail is kept to a minimum, recognizing that most readers are simply interested in using GIS effectively. The text is carefully illustrated with worked case-studies using archaeological data.

• Do predictive models that have been created for military installations work? 
• Can they be refined to work better? 
• Are they sufficiently accurate so that land managers and State Historic Preservation  
 officers can use them in evaluating management decisions about installation resources? 
• Can a predictive model be integrated into a more dynamic operational model that would be useful across the DoD to increase cost efficiency of cultural resource management at large installations? 
 
The proposal defined a three-step process for answering these questions. The first step was to determine the pervasiveness of predictive modeling in the military through a questionnaire sent to installations representing all branches of the service. Although not intended to be a complete canvassing of the military use of predictive models, the objective of the questionnaire was to achieve a reasonable sample from which inferences could be drawn. The second step was to choose models from four of the responding installations for an in-depth evaluation of their technical quality, accuracy, and general utility as a management tool. This evaluation was to include suggestions about ways to improve the utility of each model. The proposed third step was take the results of the evaluation and design a follow-up study that could directly contribute to more effective use of predictive modeling by military installations.  
 
Below we describe the questionnaire and the selection process. The next section of this report provides an evaluation of each of the four selected predictive models. In the final section of the report, we suggest what we would propose as a useful follow-up study.},

              Julian Steward's theory of Great Basin cultural ecology and settlement patterns has been subjected to empirical validation. Since the only data available to test this hypothesis are archaeological, it was first necessary to determine the artifactual correlates for the posited ethnographic system. These deductive propositions were determined by the
              BASIN I
              computer simulation model. On the basis of data obtained in a regional random sampling project in the Reese Valley of central Nevada, over 75\% of the nearly 130 deductive predictions were statistically verified. The rejected propositions probably reflect failure of the computer model rather than shortcomings in Steward's theory. The archaeological manifestation of the Shoshonean pattern is defined as the
              Reese River Subsistence-Settlement System
              which operated in the central Great Basin from about 2500 B.C. to historic times.},

	abstract = {To enhance high-frequency perceptual information and texture details in remote sensing images and address the challenges of super-resolution reconstruction algorithms during training, particularly the issue of missing details, this paper proposes an improved remote sensing image super-resolution reconstruction model. The generator network of the model employs multi-scale convolutional kernels to extract image features and utilizes a multi-head self-attention mechanism to dynamically fuse these features, significantly improving the ability to capture both fine details and global information in remote sensing images. Additionally, the model introduces a multi-stage Hybrid Transformer structure, which processes features at different resolutions progressively, from low resolution to high resolution, substantially enhancing reconstruction quality and detail recovery. The discriminator combines multi-scale convolution, global Transformer, and hierarchical feature discriminators, providing a comprehensive and refined evaluation of image quality. Finally, the model incorporates a Charbonnier loss function and total variation (TV) loss function, which significantly improve training stability and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, compared to the SRGAN algorithm, achieves average improvements of approximately 3.61 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), 0.070 (8.2\%) in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and 0.030 (3.1\%) in Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) across multiple datasets, showing significant performance gains.},

However, due to the limitation of the optic and sensor technologies and the high cost to update the sensors and equipments, the spectral and spatial resolution of the Earth Observation satellites may not meet the desired requirements. Thus, Remote Sensing Image Super-resolution (RSISR) which aims at restoring the high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images from the given low-resolution (LR) images has drawn considerable attention and witnessed the rapid development of the deep learning (DL) algorithms. In this research, we aim to comprehensively review the DL-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods on optical remote sensing images. First, we introduce the DL techniques utilized in SISR. Second, we summarize the RSISR algorithms thoroughly, including the DL models, commonly used remote sensing datasets, loss functions, and performance evaluation metrics. Third, we present a new multi-sensor dataset that consists of Very High-Resolution satellite images from different satellites of various landscapes and evaluate the performance of some state-of-the-art super-resolution methods on this dataset. Finally, we envision the challenges and future research in the RSISR field.},

The integration of AI (artificial intelligence) into archaeological methodologies is enhancing research, analysis, and preservation practices. This paper focuses on the changing dynamics of AI applications in archaeological research, pointing out the phases of trend detection, technological progress, and collaborative networks: using bibliometric analysis, co-authorship networks, and keyword density visualizations, we select the dominant topics affecting the discipline, such as ML (machine learning), remote sensing, and predictive modelling. The data indicates that new technologies, such as automated detection systems and neural networks, have greatly improved strategies for site discovery and preservation. However, there exist significant issues like data access, ethical concerns, and technology inequalities across research fields. This study aims to provide a thorough and up-to-date synthesis of AI\&rsquo;s role in archaeology, highlighting its potential to define new best practices for heritage conservation and defining a framework for future research and collaboration. Finally, this research underlines the importance of using interdisciplinary approaches to ensure that AI serves not only as an efficient tool, but also as an ethical and sustainable means of maintaining humanity\&rsquo;s shared cultural heritage.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming landscape archaeology by enabling the automated analysis of high-resolution datasets, such as airborne laser scanning (ALS). The Automatic Detection of Archaeological Features (ADAF) tool is an example of the potential of AI to streamline the identification of subtle surface features and demonstrate their value in uncovering and understanding archaeological landscapes. By improving the detection of archaeological sites, the ADAF plays a crucial role in the research, management and preservation of cultural heritage.ADAF uses advanced AI models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation and object detection, to detect features in ALS datasets. The tool has been trained on a large archive of ALS data from Ireland and processes visualised inputs to detect patterns indicative of archaeological structures. The workflow integrates pre-processing with the Relief Visualisation Toolbox, inference with trained AI models and post-processing to refine the results to ensure reliable outputs with minimal false positives.Designed with accessibility in mind, ADAF features an intuitive user interface that removes the barriers traditionally associated with AI-driven analyses. Users can process ALS data and export GIS-compatible results without the need for specialised knowledge, making the tool suitable for a wide audience. This approach democratises the use of AI in landscape archaeology and extends its utility to professionals and researchers in the field.Tests with Irish ALS datasets have shown that ADAF is able to detect both known and previously unrecognised archaeological features in the landscape, while enhancing the spatial accuracy of identified sites. By automating complex data analysis, ADAF underlines the efficiency, precision and scalability of AI in landscape archaeology. In addition, the tool contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage by identifying sites that would otherwise remain undiscovered and enabling their preservation and integration into cultural heritage management strategies.ADAF represents a significant advance in the application of AI in landscape archaeology, providing a powerful and accessible solution for surface feature recognition. Its development underlines the transformative potential of AI to revolutionise the study and interpretation of archaeological landscapes.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian based archaeological survey is commonly used throughout the western United States to locate, identify, record, and interpret archaeological sites. While procedures, such as transect spacing, transect orientation, data collection, artifact documentation, and site criteria may vary, most survey methods share a common goal: to locate and define the boundaries of archaeological sites. Other researchers question the traditional site-based survey method. Critics suggest that site-based surveys may fail to adequately detect and document artifacts outside of site boundaries (Dunnell and Dancey 1983; Wandsnider and Camilli 1992). Site-based methods may not discern archaeological signatures of past cultures that occurred on the scale of landscapes rather than discrete sites (Ebert 1992; Robins 1998)
In response, siteless approaches have been developed to test and address perceived shortcomings of site-based survey methods. The siteless survey utilizes artifacts as the basis for studying the relationships between clustered and non-clustered materials. This thesis examines traditional site-based survey vs. siteless survey within a study area in southern Idaho. Moreover, the study investigates the utility of the nonsite approach to identify spatial distributions, associations, and patterning in cultural materials on the surface of the analysis area. The results of the survey, data management and analyses evaluate if artifacts are randomly distributed or aggregated.
Survey results compare the surveys’ effectiveness in detecting artifacts. In this comparison, the effects of artifact obtrusiveness/visibility are considered. Results of survey data are examined at different spatial scales to identify clusters and evaluate cluster attributes. Spatial patterning analyses use GIS software including the Getis Ord Gi* hot spot analysis tool and the buffer tool in ArcMap 10.2. Both GIS analyses successfully identified clustering. Finally, the results of analysis compare artifact cluster attributes identified by GIS analyses with site attributes. Siteless survey data and post-field, GIS analyses demonstrate the ability to offer information not available through traditional site-based survey. These results suggest that the siteless survey methods and analytic techniques employed in this study warrant further testing and evaluation.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

Recently, machine learning (ML) has been employed as a promising method for automating and standardizing the identification of these traces. While the number of use-wear analysts using ML continues to grow, discussions regarding the effectiveness and appropriate implementation of these methods are ongoing. The main aim of this literature review is to provide recommendations for the more effective application of ML in use-wear analysis and archaeological research, by identifying trends, research gaps, and evaluating the quality of the models developed. There are three key challenges identified. Firstly, the limited adoption of open science practices restricts the creation of large datasets and hinders reproducibility and transparency. Secondly, research efforts are concentrated within limited institutions, focusing on certain research questions, algorithms, raw materials, and use-wear traces. Thirdly, the inadequate quality, quantity, and diversity of data affect the performance of the models being developed. To address these challenges, this paper advocates for the promotion of open science and the systematic gathering of experimental and analytical data. Involving a broader range of institutions can improve research quality and promote greater diversity of perspectives. Collaboration with computer scientists and computational archaeologists is essential to integrate the expertise necessary for designing and implementing effective ML methods. By addressing these factors, this paper facilitates the effective use of machine learning, enabling use-wear analysts and archaeologists to develop robust models that automate, accelerate, and improve their research.},

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},
